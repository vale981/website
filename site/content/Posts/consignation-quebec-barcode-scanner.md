I recently found myself with an overflowing recycling bin full of
bottles and cans. In Quebec, where I currently reside, I feel right at
home as a German. People almost as grumpy and impersonal as back
home, they're very strict about their language and you get refunds for
_some_ beverage containers. Unfortunately, the rest of Canada is not
that enlightened and thus there's no special mark on the cans and
bottles. Now, the [online list](https://consignaction.ca/en/liste-des-contenants-de-boisson-consignes/) is there for your perusal, but it's a
pain to enter each article in the (quite inadequately functioning)
search bar.

So rather than spending half an hour sorting the bin, I embarked on a
four-hour hacking session to make an android app that searches this
database (which is published as an excel sheet [here](https://consignaction.ca/partenaires/detaillants/boite-a-outils-des-detaillants-partenaires/)) by scanning the
qr code on the beverage container.

Easy as pi!

Here's the result:
