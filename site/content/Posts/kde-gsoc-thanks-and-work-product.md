First of all: A big thanks to my mentor Jasem Mutlaq and the KStars
Team.

Jasem, you were extremely helpful whilst leaving me a lot of
freedom. With patience you have endured my mood swings and occasional
panics :P. It has always been a pleasure working with you and I am
certain that this will continue to be the case.

Furthermore, the rest of the KStars Team, especially Akarsh Simha,
Wolfgang Reissenberger and Robert Lancaster who have found bugs,
helped me to debug them and suggested improvements[^fn:1].

I also thank Yuri Chornoivan for correcting all the typos that I've
inadvertently introduced into the handbook and the comments in the
code.
