Hi folks, talking to you over the interwebs is Valentin Boettcher who
is overhauling the Deep Sky Object (DSO) system in the KStars Desktop
Planetarium for the Google Summer of Code anno domini 2021.

This is the first post in a series and rather late in the coming, so
let's get right to it.

I'm currently studying for a master’s degree in physics at the TU-Dresden
in, you've guessed it correctly, the beautiful city of Dresden
(Germany). In Germany, we do have two study terms per year and the
summer term usually coincides neatly with the GSOC so that I couldn't
participate in past years. This time around however, my schedule was
finally sparse enough for me to have a go at it, and here we are :).

My first contact with KStars development was back in 2017 while I
spent a year in New Zealand and had a lot of time at hand. My
reasoning was, that I could learn mathematics and physics in UNI and
should funnel my enthusiasm into familiarizing myself with software
development and the open source software community. I promptly wiped
my hackintosh laptop to put Linux with KDE on it[^3]. After reading
ESR's famous ["How To Become A
Hacker"](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html), I followed
the advice given therein, which was to find an open source project and
start hacking on it. I already liked KDE and space, so KStars was in
the center of the Venn-diagram :P.  I went ahead and busied myself
with one of the junior jobs listed on the KStars web-site[^2]. I
quickly found that I liked figuring out how stuff in KStars worked and
also got in contact with my mentor Jasem Mutlaq who was always
available to answer questions and endure my barrage of instant
messages on matrix :P. My second job was to draw comets a tail and
learned that it is wise to do some code archaeology before going ahead
and implementing functionality that is already present. From there on
I contributed more or less regularly when I found the time in my
semester breaks.

Now, finally, let's talk a wee bit about the actual GSOC project.  In
KStars, everything that isn't a Star or an object in our solar system,
an asteroid, a satellite or a comet (I'm sure I forgot something) is a
deep sky object (DSO). Prominent members of the DSO caste are galaxies
(think M31, Andromeda), asterisms and nebulae. Of course there are a
plethora of catalogs for specific types of DSOs (for example, Lynds
Catalog of Dark Nebulae) as well as compilations like the New General
Catalogue.  The system for handling those catalogs in KStars has grown
rather "organically" and is now a tangle between databases, CSV files
and special case implementations. Many catalogs were mentioned
explicitly in the code, making it hard to extend and generalize. Also,
the sources of the catalogs and methods how they were transformed into
the KStars format were inhomogeneous and hard to reproduce, making
deduplication almost impossible. Finally, KStars just loaded all the
DSOs into memory and computed their position on the virtual sky for
every draw cycle, which made all too large catalogs infeasible.  My
task is now (and has been since the beginning of June) to implement a
unified catalog format which can be loaded into a central database and
supports deduplication. Furthermore, taking inspiration from the
handling of star catalogs in KStars, the objects should be trixel[^1]
indexed and cached in and out of memory (but only for large
catalogs). Finally, it would be very desirable to make the
creation/compilation of the catalogs reproducible and easily
extendable to facilitate future maintenance.

This sounds like a big heap of stuff to get done and in the next post
I will be detailing how it's going so far :).

Cheers,
Valentin


[^1]: In KStars the sky is subdivided into triangular pixels "Trixels".

    Assigning each object to a trixel makes it efficient to retrieve all objects from a certain part of the sky.

[^2]: which had to do with figuring out why some faint asteroids where missing

Of course the task I described in the [[*KDE GSOC: Intro][last post]] looks and is quite
monumental. That is why I laid some of the groundwork for my GSOC
beforehand (in the actual German semester breaks). This work continued
in the community bonding and first coding period and will therefore be
described here.

But first I want to thank my mentor Jasem Mutlaq for his support, his
patience with me and his nerves of steel. My mood levels were somewhat
similar to a huge-amplitude sine wave those last weeks.

Now to the meat...

I began by studying the existing deep sky object implementation in
KStars to identify what structure the new catalogs should have and
what the smallest irreducible core of functionality was I could
replace to make integration easier. I discovered that the catalogs
were a mix of SQL databases and text files, somehow loaded at startup
and then appended to some linked list. There was some deduplication
implemented but like most DSO code it was oddly catalog
specific. Especially the Messier, IC and NGC catalogs were often
mentioned in the code. Also the explicit distinction between stars and
DSOs made writing general code complicated but I found a consistent
set of data fields shared by all catalog objects which all admitted
sane defaults. It wasn't bad code or anything like that. Just the
product of "organic groth" with many thing I wanted already present in
some way but somewhat all over the place. I admit that I studied the
code just enough to find out what exactly I had to replace and maybe I
could have reused more of the existing code but I've picked this
specific path in the multiverse, so let's get on with it. Just a shout
out to all who did previous work on the DSO code among whom are, just to
name a few, Jason Harris, Rishab Arora, Thomas Kabelmann and Akarsh
Simha.

With this knowledge I was able to go forward and devise a concrete
plan for implementing the new DSO system. First of all, albeit I would
love to use ~std::variant~ and some kind of entity component system
for the different DSO types I settled with a one-for-all type for deep
sky objects. The primary reason for this was, that KStars uses ~C++14~
which lacks variants (and the extremely useful
~std::optional~). Furthermore the DSOs all share common structure, so
this was just the simpler and thus preferable option. The second
design decision was not to load all of the DSOs into memory, but
instead to take inspiration from the deep star catalogs. For one they
are dynamically loaded from a special trixel indexed format so this
already was within the formulated goals of the endeavor. On the other
hand the notion of having "canonical" copies of catalog objects in
memory and syncing their mutation with the database system seemed
overly complicated. The catalog database should be the single source
of truth and not the (ephemeral) memory of KStars.

When a specific object is needed, it should just be retrieved from the
database locally in the code instead of searching some in memory list
in KStars or shooting around with pointers. This notion is somewhat at
odds with how things were and are done in KStars which created some
interesting problems later on as we shall see. These ideas somewhat
dictated the rest of the plan which I (for the first time in my
programming career) completely wrote down in advance. The heart of it
all is the database manager which abstracts maintaining, reading from
and writing to the database. As always one should justify the creation
of a special data type. In this case it was the requirement that the
database access should be painless and could be handled locally
anywhere in the code just by creating another instance of the database
manager. The manager should handle retrieving objects and catalog meta
information as well as importing, editing and exporting catalogs.

The structure of the database itself was another point of
consideration. Naturally each catalog should have its own table. But
how should deduplication work?  The method I settled on is really
quite simple. Each object gets a (relatively stable) hash that is
calculated from some of its properties which is henceforth called the
ID.  When two objects (from different catalogs or otherwise) are the
same _physical_ object, then they will both be assigned the same
object id (OID) which is just the ID of the object in the "oldest"
catalog (with the lowest catalog id), trying to make it stable under
the introduction of new catalogs. Additionally each catalog is
assigned a priority value which is just a real number (conventionally
between zero and one). When loading objects from the database into
KStars and there are multiple objects with the same OID only the one
from the catalog with the highest priority will be loaded. This simple
mechanism should cover the requirements of KStars quite well and is
relatively easy to implement.

There I ran into an issue that demanded some research and
table in the database.  The simplest option would be just to create a
benchmarking. Remember that each catalog is represented by its own
so-called view, a dynamic "virtual" table that combines all the
catalog into one homogeneous table. SQL magic could automatically
perform the deduplication algorithm outline above and everything would
be fine and dandy. However, benchmarking revealed that actually
writing the view into its own table, henceforth called the master
catalog/table, increased the performance quite considerably, enough so
to justify the increased complexity in the implementation. And then I
discovered SQL indexes. A gift from the heavens! They increased
performance on loading objects in a trixel from the master catalog
roughly threefold and I was sold on the master catalog approach. So to
summarize it all; a deduplicated view of the combined catalog tables
is being created and then written into the master table. This has to
be done for every modification of the catalogs but is relatively fast
(just not fast enough to be done 20 times per second). Later
experimentation showed that this approach could accommodate catalogs
up to a million objects in size.

I also created a catalog file format, which is just an sqlite database
file with the application id set to a special value with almost the
same structure as the catalog database proper. The application id
enables KStars to check if the database is really a catalog file and
not to rely just on the structure of the contained database for
that. In the future the ~file~ command and other utilities like file
managers could be made aware of this special application id to
recognize the catalog files. We will leave it this level of detail for
now. For more details please refer to my [[https://protagon.space/stuff/kstars_cleaned.org][notes]].

Of course the operations on catalogs have to somehow be accessible in
the GUI of KStars so this was another point of action. Before that
however the glue between the database manager and the usual sky
composite system had to be implemented. In KStars different types of
objects (Stars, Comets, Asteroids, etc. pp.) all are implemented as
components with a unified interface. These components provide methods
for loading and drawing objects, as well as utilities to find objects
near a certain point on the sky and similar things. The loading and
drawing part was relatively simple to implement. The drawing code
could be straight up reused from the old implementation and the
loading was essentially covered by the database manager but with a
twist.

To support very large catalogs it would be desirable to only have
objects in memory which are currently visible. Thus a LRU cache was
implemented with the trixel id, which essentially labels a portion of
the sky, as key. This cache is fully unit tested and relies completely
on standard library containers so not a single pointer appears in the
code.[fn:1] As an added bonus, the cache is completely transparent by
default and only takes effect if configured to so and therefore
includes the typical use case of comparatively small catalogs up to
ten-thousands of objects.

But here the culture clash between the new DSO implementation and the
traditional KStars way of things became apparent. In many places
KStars expects pointers to so called ~SkyObjects~ with no real clue as
to where they are actually stored and how their memory is managed and
with the implication that the object is expected to live
forever. Well, the DSOs from the catalogs aren't supposed to be kept
around forever and thus a compromise is in order. So whenever a
pointer to an object is required, it is inserted into a linked
list[fn:2] in a hash table with the trixel as index or is taken from
there if it's already present. I hope that we can eventually
transition away from raw pointers and manage life time either
explicitly or with smart pointers.

With this done and basic drawing working I went on to implement a
basic GUI for catalog management[fn:3].  I also wrote unit tests for
the database functionality which proved itself as very useful later
on. After that I couldn't delay anymore. Back when I implemented the
component for the new DSOs I went as far as getting it to compile and
not much further[fn:4].

Now I had to go around and find out what broke. A lot broke and I did
not find all of it until the big merge :P.  A rather interesting
source of work happened to be the way metadata like observation notes
and image links were stored. They came from a text file and then were
loaded into the sky objects at startup and somehow synchronized with
the text files on mutation. This, of course, played not well with the
new DSOs as they were ephemeral. So I replaced the whole shebang with
a hash table which incidentally improved startup performance. The rest
of the integration work was similarly interesting and continues
today. I will not go into it further but feel free to look at the
KStars commit history.

Just yesterday I added a feature back in that I had axed accidentally
to the dismay of its original author. That showed me that I am not
entitled to judge the merit of individual features and whether they
could be sacrificed for the "greater good". The answer is: They
cannot! Another lesson I've learned is, that too much magic just ain't
no good. I had created a variadic template wrapper for the ~QSqlQuery~
type for syntactical convenience and shot myself in the food with
it. It ended up obscuring an error message and prevented me from
reproducing a crash that users on certain platforms were
experiencing. After a not-so-great couple of days I, with the help of
two kind people, finally found the lowest common denominator of the
problem: an old, but still supported version of QT which bundled an
old version of sqlite which in turn did not support the ~NULLS FIRST~
directive that I was using. Turtles all the way down. Although I
tested all my changes on KDE Neon (I am on NixOS primarily) the wise
thing would have been to develop or at least test everything with an
older QT version from the get go.

Also, although I had put in version checking into the database code, I
didn't provide a mechanism for upgrading the database format to new
versions. This I now remedied by introducing a simple mechanism that
applies database modifications successively for each version
upgrade. So if I go from version two to version four it will be
upgraded from version two to three and then to four which I understand
is the way those things are usually done.

Now, I did do at least some "constructive" work, adding a (admittedly
ugly) CSV importer so that users can import arbitrary CSV-ish
catalogs. The greater chunk however I will cover next week: The python
catalog package tooling with continuous integration and
deduplication. The catalogs churned out by that framework are then
installed via the ~KNewStuff~ framework. I discovered two interesting
bugs in this framework because KStars seems to be almost the only
program using the framework in this specific way.

If you made it this far, I applaud and thank you for your endurance.
See you next time.

Cheers,
Valentin

P.S. Currently I am working on documenting both the new DSO GUI and
the python tooling. I hope eventually they will pass the "noob test"
:P. But, as you may have recognized above, I am not the best explainer.

[fn:4] I really appreciate c++ as a compiled language.

[fn:3] See the KStars Handbook.

[fn:2] References to objects in linked lists are stable.

[fn:1] As a matter of fact, I set out with the goal not to do any
manual memory management and not to use a single pointer in the new
code. I have been successful thus far if you would be so lenient not
to count glue code for legacy KStars systems.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
TL;DR DSO catalogs in KStars are now generated reproducibly in the
CI. A list of available catalogs and documentation can be found [[https://protagon.space/catalogs/pages/catalogs.html][here]].
#+END_QUOTE

As promised [[id:b8c4e6f0-186b-4623-9d98-3110a5d8942c][last time]] I'll now go a little into the [[https://invent.kde.org/vboettcher/kstars-catalogs][Catalogs
Repository]].

Usually DSO catalogs are pretty static and rarely change due to the
nature of their contents. But although galaxies do not tend to jump
around in the sky, catalogs still get updates to correct typos or
update coordinates with more precise measurement. Our primary catalog
[[https://github.com/mattiaverga/OpenNGC][OpenNGC]] for example gets updates quite regularly.

#+DOWNLOADED: screenshot @ 2021-08-08 12:21:27

And even though a catalog might not change, it would nevertheless be
desirable to have a record on how it was derived from its original
format in a /reproducible/ way[fn::And in a way that hopefully lasts
for some time. Currently very few people know how to generate KStars'
deep star catalogs...]. Last but not least, having all catalogs in a
central place in kind of the same format would make deduplication a
lot easier.

The question is: how does one define a convenient yet flexible format
that nevertheless enforces some kind of structure? My answer was: with
some kind of package definition. What about the flexibility part?
Well, basically every catalog is just a python module that must
implement a class. By overwriting certain methods, the catalog can be
built up. The framework provides certain support functionality and an
interface to some catalog database features by way of a python binding
to some =KStars= code. Apart from that one has complete freedom in
implementing the details although some conventions should be
followed[fn::I haven't yet worked those out yet TBH.].

A simple random catalog looks like the following listing.

#+begin_src python
  def generate_random_string(str_size, allowed_chars=string.ascii_letters):
      return "".join(random.choice(allowed_chars) for x in range(str_size))


  class RandomCatalogBase(Factory):
      SIZE = 100
      meta = Catalog(
          id=999,
          name="random",
          maintainer="Valentin Boettcher <hiro@protagon.space>",
          license="DWYW Do what ever you want with it!",
          description="A huge catalog of random DSOs",
          precedence=1,
          version=1,
      )

      def load_objects(self):
          for _ in range(self.SIZE):
              ob_type = random.choice(
                  [ObjectType.STAR, ObjectType.GALAXY, ObjectType.GASEOUS_NEBULA]
              )
              ra = random.uniform(0, 360)
              dec = random.uniform(-90, 90)
              mag = random.uniform(4, 16)
              name = generate_random_string(5)
              long_name = generate_random_string(10)

              yield self._make_catalog_object(
                  type=ob_type,
                  ra=ra,
                  dec=dec,
                  magnitude=mag,
                  name=name,
                  long_name=long_name,
                  position_angle=random.uniform(0, 180),
#+end_src

It implements only the ~load_objects~ build phase and is a kind of
minimum viable catalog.

The basic idea behind the structure of a catalog implementation is
that the build process can be subdivided into four /phases/ which can
be partially parallelized by the framework.

In the download phase each catalog defines how its content may be
retrieved from the Internet or otherwise acquired. In the load/parse
phase the acquired original data is being parsed and handed over to
the framework which takes care of molding it into the correct
format. During the deduplication phase each catalog can query the
catalog database to detect and flag duplicates. And in the final dump
phase the contents of each catalog are written into separate files
which =KStars= can then import[fn::The catalog package files actually
do have the same format as the main DSO database :).].

If you are interested in the details I can recommend the [[https://protagon.space/catalogs/][documentation]]
for the catalog repository.

After implementing the framework porting over all the existing
catalogs to the new system, I went on to configure the KDE Invent CI
to rebuild the catalogs upon changes. The CI artifacts are sync-ed to
the ~KNewStuff~ data server for KStars periodically and users are able
to update their catalogs to the latest version.

To get the CI working I had to create a [[https://invent.kde.org/vboettcher/python-kstars-docker][Docker image]] that encapsulates
the more or less complicated build process for the KStars python
bindings. This container is updated weekly by CI and is also suitable
as a quick-and-easy development environment for new catalogs.

That's it for today but do not fret. This is not all that I've
done. There's still more to come including something that has to do
with the following picture.

*** KDE GSOC: Wrapping it up...                                 :GSOC:

Well, we all know that the work on open source projects is never truly
finished, but all of the core goals have been achieved and the time
is up :). In this post I'll briefly summarize my GSOC work and then
talk about one last small but user-facing feature that I've
implemented.

I've successfully implemented a new DSO backend and smoothed out most
of the bugs. The [[id:8f16ce69-3ed9-4e09-992a-47e511e9bb0b][python framework]] does work satisfactory and all
existing catalogs have been ported. There remains the UGC catalog
which will be imported in the future, either by me or by another
member of the project. The latter option would be a good way to
battle-test the documentation and I would prefer this option because I
do not want to remain the only person familiar with the system.

To quantify my contributions during the GSOC period see the snippet
below, although I do not think such numbers have much to say[fn::I
deleted the old OpenNGC text catalog which contained more than ten
thousand lines :P.].
#+begin_src shell
   Valentin Boettcher <hiro@protagon.space>:
          insertions:    15193  (19%)

          commits:       76     (23%)
          lines changed: 38595  (26%)
#+end_src
Furthermore there is
=https://invent.kde.org/education/kstars/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=merged&author_username=vboettcher=
(the list of my merge requests)[fn::You have to paste this link into
the url bar manually to make it work!] which does go into more detail.

The user-facing side of my work is not very prominent. There is a
small GUI for managing catalogs that allows importing, exporting,
creating and editing catalogs.

#+DOWNLOADED: screenshot @ 2021-08-16 20:13:41

[[file:static/images/KDE_GSOC:_Wrapping_it_up.../2021-08-16_20-18-49_screenshot.png]]

There is also a basic CSV importer that should make it easier for
users to get their own custom data into KStars.

#+DOWNLOADED: /home/hiro/Documents/Projects/kstars/doc/csv_openngc.png @ 2021-08-16 20:30:54
#+CAPTION: The CSV importer. It sure needs some prettying up :P.
[[file:static/images/KDE_GSOC:_Wrapping_it_up.../2021-08-16_20-30-54_csv_openngc.png]]

Nevertheless, the main goal of my work was to create a seamless
replacement for the old DSO system of which the user should not be too
aware. To that end, I've implemented a feature that should have been
in my overhaul from the beginning: a mechanism to import custom
objects [[https://invent.kde.org/education/kstars/-/merge_requests/377][from the old DSO database]]. Now, on startup the user is being
asked whether the old database should be imported if it is present.
#+DOWNLOADED: screenshot @ 2021-08-16 20:38:10
[[file:static/images/KDE_GSOC:_Wrapping_it_up.../2021-08-16_20-38-10_screenshot.png]]

And finally: Colors!

The DSOs always had a distinct color depending on the catalog they're
from. Right from the outset one complaint from early testers were the
garish colors that I chose for the catalogs. I "fixed" this problem by
simply choosing more subdued colors. But colors are a matter of
personal taste. Also, a single color can't fit all of KStars' color
schemes. Therefore colors can now be customized for each catalog and
color scheme through a "pretty" dialog.

#+DOWNLOADED: screenshot @ 2021-08-16 20:52:46
#+CAPTION: The "pretty" color picker.
[[file:static/images/KDE_GSOC:_Wrapping_it_up.../2021-08-16_20-52-46_screenshot.png]]

Now you can do things like this:

#+DOWNLOADED: screenshot @ 2021-08-16 20:49:03
#+CAPTION: Color Scheme: Moonless Night
[[file:static/images/KDE_GSOC:_Wrapping_it_up.../2021-08-16_20-49-03_screenshot.png]]

#+CAPTION: Color Scheme: Starchart
[[file:static/images/KDE_GSOC:_Wrapping_it_up.../2021-08-16_20-51-16_screenshot.png]]

And again I've learned that user feedback is very important. I would
never have thought of this feature on my own but must admit that it
enhances the usability of KStars greatly.

With that oddly specific foray into the world of colors I now conclude
this blog post and thank you for your attention.

Cheers,
Valentin

I am currently working on a project which involves talking to the
~systemd~ userspace session via the session ~dbus~ instance.

After some fiddling around and enabling debug mode on travis via the
excellent user support, I came up with the following.

Travis uses VMs that run ~ubuntu~ which comes with ~systemd~.  To
enable the userspace ~dbus~ session, one has to install the
~dbus-user-session~ package. After the installation, it has to be
activated through ~systemctl --user start dbus~. Furthermore one has
to set the ~DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS~ environment variable through
~export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/$(id -u)/bus~.

TL;DR
#+begin_src yaml

  - sudo apt update
  - sudo apt install dbus-user-session
  - systemctl --user start dbus
  - export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/$(id -u)/bus

:PROPERTIES:

:EXPORT_DATE: [2020-07-11 15:00]
:END:
Note to my future self :).

Reloading my Linux install after a pretty radical 'nuke and pave' I
had to get my Windows dualboot back to work.  There are a thousand
guides on how to do that, but I'll add another one in case your setup
is similar to mine.

I have installed windows on a separate drive and Linux on my main
drive, along with the efi partition.

Don't follow this guide blindly. Think about every step you take,
because you can seriously mess up your system :).

With that out of the way, the things you have to do are:
 1. Boot a windows install medium.
 2. Choose your language and enter the 'repair options'.
 3. Go to advanced and select 'command line'.
 4. To mount the efi partition type diskpart and in diskpart then type
    list volume. A list of volumes will be printed and one of them the
    efi partition (usually around 500mb ). Select this partition
    (select volume ~[number]~) and assign a drive letter (~X~ is the
    drive letter you assign).
 5. Check where your windows partition is mounted. The diskpart list
    volume output will probably include it. I will assume that it is
    volume ~C~. Exit diskart with ~exit~.
 6. To finally install the boot files type the command ~bcdboot
    c:\windows /s x:~. This will generate boot files based on
    ~c:\windows~ and install them on the partition with the letter
    ~X~.

Thats it, you can reboot now.  You may have to reconfigure grub (or
whatever loader you use). On arch-linux, make sure you have os-prober
installed :).

darf die Methode und Hardware dokumentieren und optimieren,
bzw. software dafür entwickeln. Meine Arbeit trägt Früchte: der Stream
muss schon seit zwei Tagen nicht täglich vier mal (oder noch öfter)
manuell via TeamViever neu gestartet werden. Auch habe ich ein simples
Übergangswebinterface (mit einem Relay Server!) geschrieben. Good bye
Firewalls. Ich habe gestern 'zu lang' gearbeitet. So etwas kann in
Neuseeland vorkommen!

Btw. hier ist der [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gwy2IjA7z-I)
zur Albatross Cam.

Wenn die Sache vorüber ist fange ich mit dem WWOOFING (jetzt wohl doch
auf der Nordinsel) an. Vielleicht schließt sich arbeitstechnisch auch
noch was an... Je nachdem wie lange mich Edith und Matt noch aushalten
bleibe ich vorerst in Wellington.

Das mit den Bildern versuche ich ich noch hinzubekommen. Die neusten
sind aus Zealandia. Ich weiß nun warum Neuseeland so reich an
endemischen Spezies ist :).


Jaja ich muss mal einen RSS feed für die Sache einrichten :)

*** Na endlich ein neuer Post

:END:
Abenteuer.  Ich habe diesen Blog die letzten paar Monde (o.k. Gott sei
Dank nur einen Mond) sträflich vernachlässigt. Aber hurra! Ich habe
etwas erlebt und kann nun einen tatsächlich einen Blogeintrag mit
Inhalt schreiben.

Ich habe mir ein Auto (Mazda Demio) gekauft, meinen Job beendet und
bin Hals über Kopf losgeWWOOFt. Sprich: Ich habe ein paar Hosts
angeschrieben und dem ersten (und einzigen), der mir antwortete,
zugesagt.

- Ich bin freudig losgefahren und nach fünf Stunden in Taumarunui
  angekommen.
- Ich melde mich beim WWOOFing Host und werde zum Grundstück gelozt.
- Ich sehe, wie es im WWOOF Profil beschrieben war, einen Garten der
  in der nächsten Woche Objekt meiner Arbeitsbemühungen werden
  soll.

Voller Optimismus sehe ich das als gutes Zeichen an. Ein paar Minuten
später werden mir die Umstände meiner Unterbringung erläutert. Das
flaue Gefühl was mir schon seit geraumer Zeit im Kopfe herumspukt
explodiert im Angesicht einer unbeheizten nicht elektrifizierten
Hütte, einen halben Kilometer vom Haus des Hosts entfernt. Ich, der
ich von der Gastfreundschaft meiner lieben Tante (danke!) verwöhnt
bin, halte erst einmal mit meinen Gefühlen hinter dem Damm und sage
brav ja zu allem. Weiter bergab geht es als ich endgültig den
Überblick verliere und mich fragen muss wie ich von ein paar
Einmachdosen und einem Gaskocher leben soll. In meiner Verzweiflung
(und in Tränen aufgelöst), weder ein noch aus wissend telefoniere ich
mit Edith (meiner Tante) und ziehe in Betracht in einem Motel zu
übernachten und am nächsten Tag den Rückweg anzutreten. Trés Bon. Das
einzige worauf ich in Hinsicht auf diese Affäre stolz bin ist, dass
ich dem Host höflich mitteilte, dass die Situation meinen Erwartungen
nicht entspräche und ich mich für die Unannehmlichkeiten
entschuldige. Der Host zeigte Verständnis und bot mir an, mich einem
Freund zu vermitteln, der mehr Erfahrung mit WWOOFING hatte. Ich nahm
das Angebot an und sah mich Gleichzeitig nach einem neuen Host
um. Getrieben von einer Art Panik, fühlte ich mich doch auf irgend
eine Weise in einen Schlamassel hineingeraten, sagte ich einem Zweiten
WWOOFing Host zu. Bald darauf traf der Freund des Hosts mit einem
weiteren österreichischem WWWOOFer ein. Der versichert mir, das sein
Host und seine Unterbringung O.K. sei. Ich ganz vertieft in meinen
Schlamassel kam mit den Beiden in der Erwartung auf ähnlich
unerfreuliches zu anzutreffen und sehe mich positiv überrascht. Wir
sind in einem alten Maori Kongresszentrum, das kürzlich den Besitzer
gewechselt hat und nun wieder auf Fordermann gebracht wird. Ich lerne
eine zweiten deutschen (!) WWOOFer kennen und darf übernachten. Am
nächsten Tag will ich nach einem arbeitsamen Vormittag zum nächsten
Host aufbrechen, entscheide mich dann aber doch zu bleiben. Nun bin
ich schon den dritten Tag hier und habe mich mit allen
angefreundet. Micha, der deutsche WWOOFer, koch gut und gerne und ich
freue mich zu helfen und zu lernen (wir speisen vorzüglich!). Paora,
unser Host, ist ein guter Gastgeber und bäckt ein Vorzügliches 'Fried
Bread'. Ich habe bisher vormittags im Garten gearbeitet und
Nachmittags frei gehabt. Heute aber war ein Hundswetter und wir haben
eine Aufräum- und Putzaktion im Hause gestartet. Morgen ist wieder
Hundswetter und wir gehen in die heißen Quellen! Langsam gewöhne ich
mich an die Idee des WWOOFens, fühle mich nicht mehr so hilflos und
plane Ausflüge (… ich war endlich mal in der 'Stadt' und habe das
Visitor Centre besucht). Ich habe mich aber noch nicht entscheiden
können, ob das WWOOFing leben für mich taugt. Nichtsdestotrotz geht es
wieder bergauf.

Nun muss ich eingestehen das Ich ein Esel war:
1. Ich habe mir wohl nicht vorstellen können was es heißt, für sich
   allein verantwortlich zu sein.
2. Was hat mich geritten einen WWOOFing Host so weit im Norden (5h von Wellington) anzunehmen?
3. Warum habe ich, naiv wie ich bin, nicht weiter über die Gegebenheiten recherchiert?

Der Host hatte noch keine Bewertungen. Ich habe törichter weise
angenommen ich könne der erste sein, der ihm eine gute Rezension
schreibt. Tatsächlich wusste er wohl nicht wirklich über das WWOOFing
Bescheid. Ich habe durch das 'We have WiFi' in der Beschreibung
angenommen, ich sei im Wohnhaus untergebracht.

Ich werde aus all dem lernen! Aber natürlich ist es empfehlenswert
sich seiner Eseleien bewusst zu werden bevor man naiv drauf los rennt!

Gehabt euch Gut!

Es war eine schöne Woche. Viel Regen, aber auch viele interessante
Gespräche. Man reist durch Neuseeland und trifft: Deutsche. Wir waren
4 Deutsche und ein Österreicher.

Paora, unser WWOOFing Host lud uns Anfang der Woche zu einem ominösen
'Cultural Event' ein. Im laufe der Woche konkretisierte sich der
21igster Geburtstag seines Neffen als dieses Event heraus. Ein
merkwürdiger Gedanke als Wildfremder auf einen Geburtstag zu gehen,
eingeladen vom Onkel des 'Geburtstagskindes'. Wir wurden recht bald
dahingehend beruhigt, dass es ein sehr formelles Fest mit vielen Reden
und ähnlichem sei (was meine zweifel aber nicht völlig beräumte).

Geweckt vom Gesang des Mobiltelefons von Micha (einem WWOOFer) brachen
wir sechs Uhr in der Frühe auf, um 8 Uhr irgendwo im Nirgendwo bei
einem Maori Marai, gedacht für Feierlichkeiten, ankommen. Da es zu
diesem Zeitpunkt schon nichts mehr zu tun gab, ging es weiter die
Straße (den Feldweg) hinab, um zu helfen frisch unter der Erde
gebackene Fleischpacken in handliche Stücke zu zerlegen. Ich habe noch
nie im Leben solch eine Fettschicht von einem Tisch wischen
dürfen. Danach schloss sich der Offizielle Teil des Geburtstages an.

Der einundzwanzigste Geburtstag markiert bei den Maori der Eintritt in
das Erwachsenenalter und ist damit fast noch wichtiger als unser
achtzehnter Geburtstag. Wo bei uns jeder Geburtstag anders, mehr oder
weniger informell ist, so greift bei den Maori die Tradition, die
Bewundernswert bewahrt wird und, wie man uns verriet, in viele
Festivitäten gipfelt. So traten wir Gäste durch das (symbolische)
Haupttor begleitet vom Sprechgesang der Familienältesten, einer
beeindruckenden Frau mit schwarz tätowierten Lippen, in den Marai, die
Frauen zuerst und danach die Männer, ein. Danach folgten Wechselreden
von Gastgeber und Gästen. Zum einen um den 21 jährigen in die Welt der
Erwachsenen einzuführen, aber auch um die guten Absichten als Besucher
zu erklären und von den Gastebern akzeptiert zu werden. Anschließend
gab es ein großes essen, unterbrochen von zahlreichen (und langen)
Reden und beeindruckenden und lautstarken Einlagen seitens der Jungen
Männer. Schließendlich halfen wir WWOOFer die Tische abzuräumen (schon
das Zweite Extrem an diesem Tag: Ich habe noch nie so viel Chaos auf
einem Tisch gesehen :P.) und das Geschirr zu spülen. Danach ging es
ans Kuchen- bzw. Muffinbuffet und den informellen Teil. Wir hatten
viele interessante Gespräche mit den Gästen, die uns so herzlich und
selbstverständlich als Ihresgleichen betrachteten, wie es in
Deutschland wohl nicht möglich gewesen wäre. Ein unvergleichliches und
unbezahlbares Erlebnis, kaum wieder Gutzumachen, selbst durch
Küchenarbeit :).

Nun bin ich weiter Gezogen: Nach Levin an der Ost- (für unsere
Begriffe West-) Küste zu einer älteren Dame, um im Garten zu
helfen. Eine Wunderbare und herzliche Frau, bei der man sich sofort
zuhause fühlt. Sie selbst lernt gerade Ukulele (Im buchstäblichen
Sinne. Ich höre es gerade durch die Tür schallen :).) . Ihr Sohn macht
Musik für Kinder (bzw. ist Instrumentallehrer).  Nun sehen wir mal was
die Woche bringt.

Seit gegrüßt ihr, die ihr von mir so empörenswert lang vernachlässigt
wurdet.  Nach einem interssanten und anstrengenden Arbeitstag sitze
ich nun mal wieder vor der Mattscheibe und tippe frohgemut das
Vorliegende ein.

Die letzten zwei Wochen kann ich wohl zu den Schwierigsten in meinem
Leben buchen. Nach einer zweiten, einwöchigen und äußerst angenehmen
WWOOFing Erfahrung bei der Wunderbaren Jean Hollis, die mir das
Ukulelespielen zeigte und mich zum Folk Club einlud, bin ich erst
einmal zu den Robertsons zurückgekehrt und in ein tiefes Loch
gefallen. Die Angst nistete sich als ständiger Hausgast bei mir ein
und vertrieb über die zwei letzten Wochen hinweg allen Optimismus und
den größten Teil der Motivation, verhängte die Fenster und schaltete
das Licht aus. Sprich ich kam mit rationalen Gedanken nicht darüber
hinweg. Merkwürdig! Ich hatte zwei wunderbare WWOOFing Stays und
trotzdem hatte ich Angst weiter zu gehen, die Kontrolle zu verlieren
und unglücklich zu enden.

Aber ich habe das Richtige getan und bin weitergezogen. Und so kam es,
dass der Zähler nach oben tickt und ich nun ganze drei tolle Hosts
hatte/habe. Wir sind hier zu fünft: drei Deutsche und zwei
Amerikaner. Ich habe noch nie solch warmherzige Menschen erlebt.

Ich hoffe mein Ich lernt daraus und erspart mir weitere unschöne
Episoden. Die Angst klopft nur von Zeit zu Zeit in den Morgenstunden
an die Tür. Ich lasse sie nicht hinein und habe einen Weiteren tollen
Tag.

Nun gehabt euch gut. Bis zum nächsten mal :) .

Mal wieder eine Meldung…

Es waren und sind schöne Tage bei den Darwins. Wir drei Deutsche
verstehen uns prächtig und stellen uns taub sobald jemand ein
deutsches Wort spricht. Ich habe mal wieder viel erlebt und nun die
richtige Balance gefunden. ZU meinen Erlebnissen: Mount Victoria
bestiegen (danach Nüsse gekauft! Mjamjam), Victoria Universität
besichtigt (geschockt von Studiengebühren, Bibliothek ist umfangreich
und kostenlos), gewandert (Allein, mit Hund, mit Deutschen, mit Edith
und Carl) und Heute: Star Trek II im Planetarium. Die Decke der
Schusseligkeit abwerfend fällt mir ein, dass wir gestern im Rivendell
(LOTR, Stadt der Elben) Tal schwimmen waren! Es war so kalt, dass
sogar der kühle Wind angenehm erschien. Alle LOTR Fans erblassen vor
Neid! (Ich hätte es ohne Schild aber nicht erkannt.)

Ein erfülltes Reiseerlebnis bisher! Hinweg du Trübsal!  Als Ausgleich
habe ich begonnen an einem Machine Learning Kurs teilzunehmen (Hurra
habe ein Stipendium bekommen und spare 400$). Die Mathematik dazu
(Lineare Algebra) ist abwechslungsreich und wunderbar neu. Eine
Matrizengleichung abzuleiten hat mich trotz Anleitung 4 Seiten Papier
gekostet. Wie der Wind steht, werde ich mich beim Studium wohl dann
eher mathematisch orientieren: Kybernetik oder Technomathematik.

Ich lebe hier an den Grenzwerten für mein Empfinden für Sauberkeit
(Hund in Wohnung, Renovierung etc.), bin aber allein dadurch schon
weit über mich hinaus gewachsen (Eigenlob, Lob, Lob, Lob, Applaus
bitte!). Alkohol werde ich aber auch weiterhin nicht anrühren, nachdem
ich zwei, der Alkoholvergiftung nicht allzu ferne, Betrunkene in die
Stadt gefahren habe und am nächsten Tag vom weiteren verlauf des
Abdends des weniger Trinkfesten der beiden erfuhr. Derselbe wachte
nämlich nach einem Filmriss auf der Straße auf, wurde von freundlichen
Neuseeländern mit ins Haus gelassen, um auf dem Sofa zu nächtigen,
entfloh aber wieder, um dann von einem Spanier ein Taxi nach Karori,
wo wir wohnen, spendiert zu bekommen. Nachdem er sich nicht mehr an
die Adresse unseres bescheidenen Heimes erinnern konnte, endete er
nach Überkletterung des Zaunes ohne die Alarmanlage auszulösen, auf
dem Rasen des High Comissioners, telefonierte so laut mit dem zweiten,
schon Zuhause angekommenen, Deutschen, dass man es bis zu Uns hören
konnte und fand nach erneutem, langwierigem, Beklettern des Zaunes in
trunkener Tollpatschigkeit nach Hause.

Damit gehabt euch Gut und bis zum nächsten mal liebe Kinder.

In dem Bemühen meine Post-Frequenz der Frequenz der kosmischen
Hintergrundstrahlung anzupassen verfasse ich mal noch einen kleinen
Beitrag in mein (öffentliches) 'Tagebuch'.

Vorgestern waren wir im Weta-Workshop, benannt nach der indigenen
gottesanbeterartigen Weta, die in Neuseeland einmal dieselbe Nische
wie bei uns die Mäuse besetzt hat. Dort gab es allerlei Filmrequisit
und Maskerade zu sehen. Genau das wird dort nämlich, unter anderem für
LOTR und den Hobbit, produziert. Ein Schaumstoff Stahlschwert,
allerlei Äxte und Saurons Rüstung in sicherer Schaustoff-Spitzen
Variante und natürlich auch aus Vollmetal wahren erstaunlich
anzusehen, jedoch am besten ist der Halo-Offroad-Truck. Der für einen
Halo-3 Teaser geschaffene Truck ist, auf Wunsch der Producer, voll
funktionsfähig und von Grund auf selbstgebaut. Abgefahren ist er aber
nicht ... steht immer noch dort!

Gestern dann bin ich früh aufgestanden, habe einen Deutschen zum Bus
gefahren und recht früh angefangen zu arbeiten. Dem Plan nach wollte
ich eigentlich um zwei wandern gehen, habe dann aber bis um vier
getrieft, und habe meine Wanderung um fünf angetreten. Die Lower Hutt
Region bot mir schon wieder einen neuen Natureindruck, jedoch störten
die Industrieluft und der Naheliegende Highway. Generell war es ein
Tag mit relativ wenig lichten Momenten. So etwas passiert. Ich habe
gelernt nicht zu sehr unterzutauchen.

.... Brzzzzt, schwarzer Bildschirm, Akku alle.

Nächster Tag: Nichts Besonderes. Nur Mistwetter und mathematische
Beweise mit Nicolai.

Heute sollte ich eigentlich Edith, Matt und Carl gegen Zehn Uhr zum
Flughafen fahren, jedoch wandelte sich das Ganze zu einer Fahrt mit
der Fähre gegen Zwei am Nachmittag. Somit hatte ich am Vormittag
reichlich Zeit, in der aus einem wolkenfreien Himmel knallenden Sonne
zu lesen. (Das Komma ist korrekt gesetzt! Erweiterter Infinitiv mit
zu!) Danach überkam mich die große Verzweiflung über der Frage, was
denn mit dem restlichen sonnigen Samstag anzufangen sei. (Nun wir
sehen: Das 'zu' kann auch mitten im Wort stehen.) Glücklicher Weise
hatte Edith die Idee das ich doch den Makara-Loop-Walk machen könnte.

Im Grunde gesagt ist der Makara-Beach ein Kalenderblatt, das Gott so
sehr gefiel, dass er es in bequemer Entfernung zu Wellington entstehen
lies. Eine der schönsten Wanderungen bisher, um es kurz zu
machen. Danach wollte ich eigentlich noch das kühlende Nass ohne Sand,
denn es war ein Kiesstrand, genießen, wurde aber nach dem Abstieg von
den Klippen aus der Bahn geworfen. Ich stolperte über ein Stück
Treibolz und geriet angesichts mehrer kleiner Schürfwunden ganz aus
dem Häuschen. Ich war schon recht erschöpft, das jeder in mir einen
schnellen, straffen Wanderer zu erkennen schien und mich
vorbeilies. Das Blut aus meinen Schürfwunden an meiner Hose abwischend
tropfte ich meinen Pullover mit Blut aus meiner Nase voll, allerdings
ohne das mitzubekommen. Erst als ich eine Familienwandergruppe
verstört hinter mir zurückließ fiel mir auf, dass mein Gesicht nicht
nur vom Sonnenbrand rot war. Naja, kein Baden, aber ein schöner
Ausflug.

Cheers!

Ich habe gute Tage aber manchmal eben auch bessere :)!  Die letzte
Woche war an sich recht unspektakulär, obwohl ich einige Highlights
unterbringen konnte.  So war ich dienstags bei einem Vortrag über die
Raumfahrtmissionen zum Jupiter im Planetarium, mittwochs hörte ich ein
progressive Rock Konzert (nicht so mein Ding, aber die erste Band
“Opium Eater” war der trés Bon) und Donnerstags mit Edith Geburtstag
feiern. Ich durfte sogar das Häusliche Ethernet verkabeln. Welche
ehre!  Die letzten Tage habe ich verzweifelt versucht meine Routine am
Laufen zu halten, danach aber erkannt, das das wohl nur ein Zeichen
war, weiter zu ziehen.

Gesagt, getan (naja, war ja schon seit Wochen geplant) bin ich Gestern
nach Levin zu Jean Hollis gedüst und hatte schon einen sehr
wunderbarschönen Tag. Nach dem Rasenmähen bin ich zum Ende der Straße,
an der wir das Glück haben zu wohnen, gefahren, um dann durch ein
wenig einladen mit: “PRIVATE PROPERTY! NO ACCESS PAST THIS POINT”
(ok. das hat mich schon etwas verunsichert) gekennzeichnetes Stück
Wildnis auf einem Trampelpfad zu Strand und ins Meer zu laufen. Sehr
kalt und sehr erfrischend.

Als dann, bis bald :)

Anmerkung 1. Nov: Heute habe ich einen körperlich sehr auslastenden
Kampf mit einer Flaxpflanze gewonnen.

Hallo mal wieder. Wie es aussieht, gibt es mal wieder einen neuen
Blogpost.  Es scheint paradox, ist jedoch zumindest für mich
zutreffend: Partout habe ich das Gefühl, etwas nicht erwähnt zu
haben. Eigentlich sollte man sich doch an seine letzte Woche erinnern
können...  Nun, wie auch immer. Das was ich aus dem konfusen Brei, der
sich bei mir Gedächtniss schimpft, fischen kann und dann auch noch
ausreichend interessant erscheint, folgt nun.

Die letzte Woche war vor allem durch ein ausgezeichnetes Regenwetter
gekennzeichnet. Nicht einfach nur Regen, es kommt noch besser, auch
viel Grau und noch mehr Sauna (Sonne erhitzt zwischen Boden und Wolken
festsitzende Luft). Somit hatte ich wenig im Garten, dafür aber mehr
im Haushalt zu tun und kann nun sehr effizient den gesamten Kern in
einem Stück aus einer Walnuss schälen. Ja und die Tage verflogen. Ich
weiß wirklich nicht wie, aber am Ende des Tages hatte ich immer keine
Zeit mehr :). Einen Abend haben wir "Catch me if You Can" gesehen,
trés amusant, wenigstens an Das kann ich mich noch erinnern.

Mir kahm die zündende Idee ein Arbeitstagebuch zu führen, sodass ich
wenigstens meinen Großtaten Pralen kann. Bisher sieht das Ganze ganz
Ambitioniert so aus: (wobei ich schon einmal interpolieren musste...)


1. Nov: cutting flax, bundling it, digging it out
2. Nov: Cleaning Lamps in ceiling, cleaning inside of the car 100%
3. Nov: Filling the flax hole, cleaning plant storage, salt-watering weeds
4. Nov: Cracking Walnuts, Weeding and Pruning in Community Gardens
5. Nov: Free Day, Hiking
6. Nov: Nut Shelling, Cleanup of Garden Space, Sorting Pots
7. Nov: Vacuuming, Free Day (Museum)
8. Nov: Pruning, Weeding (long, 5h+)


Am Samstag dann hatte ich einen freien Tag und entfloh in den relativ
regenfreien Süden auf eine Wanderung am Kapiti Coast.  Nun, das Ganze
ist ausreichend photographisch dokumentiert und somit habe ich nur zu
berichten, dass ich auf dem Rückweg fast im aufgewühlten Meer baden
wollte, mich aber nicht dazu durchringen konnte. Ich habe dann aber
mit dem Auto ein paar Runden gedreht ... nicht ins Meer :P aber durch
die Umgebung. Paraparaumu ist doch ein ganzes Stück großer, als ich
zunächst annahm.

Gestern dann unternahm ich einen noch besser durch Photographie
dokumentierten Ausflug in das "Southward Car Museum".  Sir Len
Southward fing irgendwann im letzten Jahrhundert an, als Mechaniker
eine Automobilwerkstat zu führen. Das verhalf ihm dann einem Reichtum,
der nur durch das Sammeln älterer, neuerer, schöner, hässlicher,
ausgefallener, ... Automobile umgesetzt werden konnte. Und heute
können wir dank seiner Generosität das Ganze als Museum
erleben. Allein mit 10% der Ausstellung verbrachte ich meine erste
Stunde und las fast alle kleinen Täfelchen zu den Exponaten. Später
dann sparte ich mir das, um zugunsten der vollständigen Besichtigung
des Museums (Die Halle, ein Motoradbalkon und ein großer Keller), ein
schnelleres tempo an den Tag zu legen, nur noch interessantere
Exponate näher zu studieren und meinen Aufenthalt von weiteren 9
Stunden auf erträgliche 3 (insgesammt also 4) Stunden zu beschränken.

Besonders interessant waren bei all dem die alten Kuriositäten wie
das, erstaunlicher Weise zu seiner Zeit (in den 30iger Jahren
des 20. Jhd.) recht populäre, Phänomobil. Das Phänomobil ist eine Art
Dreiratswäglchen, bei dem der Motor direkt über dem Vorderrad sitzt
und sich beim Steuern mitdreht. Man lenkt dabei mit einer,
rechtwinklig zur Lenkachse angebrachten Stange und steuert den mit
zwei roten Propellern gekühlten Motor über zwei Ventile.  Desweiteren
fand ich viel Freude an diversen Sportwagen, aber auch an einem frühen
Mercedes mit Flugzeugmotor und wassergekühlten Bremsen. Man konnte den
Dreitonner nur im dritten Gang fahren, da bei den ersten beiden nur
ein Burnout (Reifendurchdrehen) zu erwarten war. Neben allerhand
verrückter Custom-Cars gab es auch verrückte Mini Autos wie die BMW
Isetta (hergestellt nach einer Linzens einer Italienischen Firma mit
einigen Verbesserungen seitens BMW), Oldtimer, motorisierte
Tandemfahrräder und Flugzeuge. Ein höchst interessanter Aufenthalt,
besonders wenn man sich die Produktionszahlen einiger Modelle
ansieht. Wenn die alle heute noch fahren würden... Auch der
Leistungsanstieg von mickrigen 8-12 PS der motorisierten ("Horseless"
fancy, fancy!!) Pferdekutschen zu Sportwagen mit 300 PS und
mehr. Zudem gab es zu Anfang einen recht großen Markt für die einfach
zu handhabenden und leisen Elektromobile, die dann aber von der
Entwicklung des Verbennungsmotors überholt wurden. Heute noch wird die
Sammlung stetig erweitert und erstaunliches an halb verwrackten Wagen
geleistet.

Heute habe ich zur Abwechslung mal schönes Wetter und hart
gearbeitet. Dabei hat mir Grübelei und Gudruns Modellansatz Podcast
die Zeit versüßt. Schon wieder ein neues Wunschstudienfach:
Technomathematik! Fast wie Kybernetik, aber noch vielseitiger.

Nun denne, jetzt gehts für den Sonnenuntergang auf zum Strand! Bis zum
nächsten mal.

*** Fiji

:END:
Frisch aus dem Urlaub im Urlaub. Ich grüße von Fiji, denn ich schreibe
diesen Eintrag schon auf der Insel und veröffentliche ihn erst
jetzt. Ein paar wunderbare und sehr komfortable Tage waren es.  Wir
wohnen hier in einem sehr schönen Ferienhaus mit Pool, Meeresblick
(bzw. Sonnenuntergangsblick) und erfrischender Brise zur
Abendstunde. Viel Entspannung und viel Freizeit. Das ganze erinnert
mich an Gozo mit ein bisschen mehr grün, der der gleichen Hitze.  Wir
haben auch zwei “Bedienstete”, die das Haus in Ordnung halten und
kochen. Auch wenn sie für Bezahlung arbeiten, so kann ich es doch
nicht ab, bedient zu werden als stände ich über anderen. Nun überfällt
mich also immer ein gewisses Unbehagen, wenn ich sie arbeiten sehe und
ich versuche ab und an zu helfen.  Als wir am ersten Tag in die Stadt
fuhren, um einzukaufen, durfte ich erfahren, was ein echter Markt
ist. Viele, kleine Stände mit frischem Gemüse und allerhand
interessanter Kleinigkeiten. Um die nötigen Preisverhandlungen
kümmerte sich unserer lokaler Führer Stanley.  Auf dem Weg zurück fiel
mir dann auf, wie arm das Land Fiji ist. Der Großteil der Bevölkerung
lebt in Wellblechhütten und unsere “Bediensteten” schätzen sich mit
einen überdurchschnittlich hohen Monatslohn von umgerechnet weniger
als 300 Euro glücklich, wobei die Lebensmittelpreise auch gesalzen
sind. Da ich gerade die Beweismethode der vollständigen Induktion
verstanden hatte, suchte mein Geist nach einem neuen Problem und so
stürzte mich die Ungleichheit auf der Welt in eine tiefe
Verzweiflung. Wie kann es sein, dass ich so ein Glück habe und in Fiji
auf einem Hügel (ja, auch im geographischen Sinne) über den in Armut
lebenden Urlaub mache. Wie kann es sein, dass ich mir dieser
Ungerechtigkeit bewusst war und dass sie mich aber nicht schon früher
zur Verzweiflung getrieben hat. Wenn nur die geringste Möglichkeit
besteht etwas ändern zu können, warum sollte ich nicht meine ganze
Kraft darauf verwenden, anstatt zu entspannen.  Nun, da ich bei diesen
Fragen zu keiner zufriedenstellenden Lösung kam, rumorte das Thema in
meinen Gedanken (und im Chat mit Nicolai, der sich das gleiche schon
etwas früher als ich gefragt hat). Arme und unterentwickelte Länder
bleiben unterentwickelt und werden ärmer. Nun wenn wir “entwickelten”
in unserem Eigennutz genau diese Umstände ausnutzen und geringe Löhne
zahlen (siehe unsere “Bediensteten”) oder Land kaufen, um dann große
Villen mit den eigenen Arbeitern anstatt den einheimischen zu
bauen. All das zu verhindern ist schwierig, aber nicht unmöglich, wenn
man im Alltag bewusster darauf achtet wo denn all das Zeug, was man so
günstig kauft, her kommt. Auch sollte man natürlich nicht
wirtschaften, um eigennützig Reichtum zu akkumulieren und auch einmal
an andere denken. All das entspricht so ziemlich der Christlichen
(oder allgemein religiösen) Lehre und wir tun nach wie vor gut daran,
danach zu leben. Ok, andere nennen das dann eben unsere “Werte”. Man
vergisst das alles aber sehr schnell und erkennt es nur wieder, wenn
man mit der Nase darauf gestoßen wird. Ich mit meiner kleinen Reise
nach Neuseeland, habe ja noch eigennütziger gehandelt, hätte ich ja
auch nach Afrika gehen können, um zu helfen. Punkt. Das also als
Auszug aus meinen Gedanken.  Nun sehe ich aber auch, dass die Leute
hier glücklich, ja wirklich glücklich sind. Wahrscheinlich sogar
glücklicher als wir, die wir uns sorgenfrei neue Sorgen schaffen und
das dann Fortschrittlichkeit nennen.  Unsere Maßstäbe passen nicht
überall, Werte aber manchmal schon eher. Auch wenn die Leute glücklich
sind, sollte man ihre Lage nicht verschlechtern, nur um in seine
Richtung weiter zu kommen. Mit welchem Recht zerstören wir eigentlich
einen Planeten, auf dem Sie noch nicht einmal die Möglichkeit hatten
genau so “toll” (schlimm) wie wir zu werden.  Wissen bringt
“Macht”. Naja wohl eher “frei”. Hier auf Fiji weiß man um den
westlichen Lebensstiel und steht darüber, auch wenn man den Touristen
zuliebe ein paar Spiegelbilder aufstellt und seine Sprache zu einem
einzelnen Wort “Bulla” (“Hallo”) verkrüppelt. Zur Erinnerung daran
wird man dann von allen Seiten damit beschmissen. Bulla, sagt der
Verkäufer, an dessen Stand ich einen Bullachino bestelle, nachdem ich
mir ein Bulla-Shirt (Fiji braucht ja auch ”Hawai-Hemden”) bei
Bulla-Looks (Ok, der Laden heißt Jack’s… und ich habe mir keines
gekauft) gekauft habe. Aber zurück zum Text. Würde hier jedes Kind
Zugang zu Bildung haben, so wäre es nicht zwangsläufig glücklicher,
dafür jedoch freier zu werden was es eben werden will. Vielleicht ist
das ein Ansatzpunkt.  Auch wenn ich aus dem Wust der Gedanken, den ich
hier nicht noch weiter ausrollen möchte, den ich aber in einer OneNote
Übersicht zu systematisieren versuche, noch keine klare Linie
herausziehen kann, so habe ich doch schon eine gewisse Synthese
gewonnen.  Umso mehr der einzelne voran kommt, ohne andere zurück zu
stoßen, umso mehr kommt das ganze voran. Umso besser der einzelne
wird, ohne anderen zu schaden, umso besser wird das ganze.  Das kling
in meinen Ohren recht egoistisch, ist jedoch das zufriedenstellendste
das ich bisher hervorgebracht habe. Lebe, so gut du kannst, und
verschließe deine Augen nicht vor deinen Fehlern.  Sollte ich einmal
zu Reichtum kommen, so setze ich ihn weise ein, sodass er zu einem
Reichtum aller wird.  Holla Marx grüßt.  Bis dann, als Bald, euer
Valentin, der sich das Ganze endlich einmal vom Herzen geschrieben
hat.  Ps: Ich bin jetzt bei einem Neuen Host und es ist
wunderschön. Mehr dazu später.

Holla. Er lebt noch. Nach ein paar interessanten, angespannten und
entspannten Wochen nehme mir endlich einmal Zeit, einen überfälligen
und hoffentlich heiß ersehnten Blogeintrag zu schreiben.

Selten kaum mir ein dermaßen praktischer Geistesblitz zu passe. So
einleuchtend im Charakter die Idee auch war, lange blieb Sie mir
dennoch Verborgen. Die Rede ist von einem, von mir nunmehr täglich in
strenger Disziplin geführten, persönlichen Tagebuch, als kleines
accompagnement zu meinem Work-Diary. Endlich muss man sich keine
Sorgen machen, das unvergessliche erlebte in seiner schieren Masse zu
vergessen. Jeden Abend also tippe ich also mehr oder manchmal auch,
der Müdigkeit geschuldet, weniger einen kurzen Tagesbericht inklusive
neuer Erkenntnisse und zwangsläufig auch Fragen. Zu eurem Leidwesen
resultierte das Ganze in einer BlogPostFaulheit, der ich mit diesem
Eintrag ein Ende zu setzen versuche.

Hmm. Wo waren wir stehen geblieben … Ich war zurück von Fiji und bin
nun…

… In Whakatane, genauer nahe Thornton Beach. Die Reise von Wellington
habe ich in zwei Hälften geteilt, um die Fahrt auch genießen zu
können. Gesehen habe ich den Tongariro National Park, oder besser: ich
habe ihn auf State Highway One durchfahren (wärmstens zu empfehlen),
ich bin auch gewandert und im eisigen Lake Taupo
geschwommen. Übernachtet habe ich in einem Backpacker Hostel und war
sehr angenehm überrascht. Sauber, leise, gemütlich und preislich sehr
attraktiv stand die Unterkunft, wie ich nun weiß, in angenehmen
Kontrast zu anderen Herbergen.  Am zweiten Tag verfuhr ich mich erst
einmal gründlich und endete an einer abgesperrten Forrest-Road, dann
an einer Weiteren und schließlich auf dem Highway. Pünktlich zum Lunch
fand ich beim dritten Versuch das Haus meiner Hosts und siehe da, eine
weitere sehr positive Überraschung wartet auf mich. Wirklich direkt in
den Sanddünen gelegen und liebevoll gestaltet, ein Ort, besser als
jedes Ferienhaus. Es lebt sich sehr schön bei den Niederländern
Wilhelmina und Gerrit und besonders das Essen ist unübertrefflich. Die
Beiden haben eine unglaubliche Menge an Olivenbäumen und stellen mit
ersten Plätzen und Goldzertifikaten ausgezeichnetes Oliven-Öl her (und
das erst seit wenigen Jahren!). Die Arbeit ist relativ hart, aber
abwechslungsreich. Sogar auf dem Markt verkaufen durfte ich! Sehr
spannend. Aus vielerlei Perspektiven zähle Will und Gerrit zu den
besten WWOOfing Hosts, bei denen ich das Glück hatte, aufgenommen zu
werden. In Konjunktion mit meiner etwas merkwürdigen und gestressten
Stimmung in den letzten Wochen muss ich aber auch gestehen, das ich
die Sache etwas ambivalent sehe. Diese Ambivalenz hat mir in letzter
Zeit sehr viel zu denken gegeben. Wir unterhalten uns wunderbar und
sehr lang zu - und nach den meisten Mahlzeiten, dennoch sind die Hosts
eher Gut, aber nicht “Warm”. Das mag von ihrer halb professionellen
Einstellung gegenüber WWOOFern liegen, wobei ich damit, nun da ich
weis, das der Garten und das Olivenöl wirklich nur Hobby sind, besser
klar komme. Will und besonders Gerrit sind schon über das Berufsleben
hinaus (Gerrit ist 69 Jahre alt, ich habe ihn auf Mitte 50 geschätzt),
brauchen die Arbeit scheinbar aber doch, denn besonders Gerrit
arbeitet bis zum Buchstäblichen Umfallen. Von uns wird das nicht
erwartet, aber dennoch spiegelt sich das in einer gewissen
Erwartungshaltung wider. In der Praxis erfährt man meistens nur, wenn
etwas falsch ist und muss Lob “erfragen”. Das alles hat sich
wahrscheinlich durch die schiere Masse an WOOFern, die hier über das
Jahr arbeiten, so eingependelt und ist nun einfach hinzunehmen. Damit
ist es auch schwieriger motiviert und effizient zu arbeiten, da einem
immer die Angst vor dem Fehler im Nacken sitzt. Um einen Schluss damit
zu machen: Es sind die ersten Hosts, bei denen ich mich in der
schwachen Position des Bittstellers sehe. Daneben aber ist alles und
besonders das Essen, Tip Top! Jeder WWOOFing Host ist anders und das
ist auch gut so!

Nun, zu entspannen das ist so eine Sache. Ich habe mich wohl etwas in
eine “ich muss meine ToDo-Liste abarbeiten, es so viel zu tun”
Stimmung hineingesteigert. Und da mir hier, weil ich endlich mal etwas
unternehme und wir so lang am Esstisch reden, erstaunlich wenig Zeit
bleibt, kann das sehr frustrierend werden. Ich sage mir jetzt: Du
kannst nur das tun, was du auch wirklich jetzt tun kannst. Nun, das
klappt mal mehr und manchmal weniger, aber die Tendenz sieht gut aus.

Ich WWOOFe hier nicht allein. In den ersten zwei Wochen gab es noch
eine Kiwi WWOOFerin in den 40igern namens Tracy. Und Tracy war und ist
wirklich das beste hier. Unglaublich großherzig, humorvoll und auch
tiefsinnig wurde Sie mir zur guten Freundin, so gut das es nur mit
Mich zu vergleichen, nicht aber in Worte zu fassen ist. Es gab viel zu
lernen vom Neuseeländischen Lebensstil der Entspanntest. Tracy selbst
ist zwar viel Gereist, war nebenbei aber Work-A-Holic und Mutter. Um
mal auszusteigen ist Sie geWWOOFt und schließlich hier gelandet. Das
eigene Land zu bereisen ist eine gute Idee. Nun jetzt weiß ich, was
ich mache, wenn ich zurück in Deutschland bin.

Das wunderschöne Whakatane ist eine sehr offene, kleine aber schöne
Stadt und so verbrachte ich meine Erste Woche hier damit zu arbeiten,
mir Sorgen zu machen und die Stadt zu bewundern. Will und Gerrit
schlugen eines Abends vor, wenn man schon einmal in der Gegend sei,
die Coromandel Halbinsel zu besichtigen (einen der schönsten
Landstriche Neuseelands). Ich, immer noch meschugge vom
Ankunfts-Schock (irgendwie hab ich den bei neuen Hosts immer), legte
die Idee erst einmal zu den Akten, bis Tracy vorschlug, man könne doch
zusammen Reisen. Also setzten wir uns ans Planen (ich hasse planen,
habe aber noch zwei Nachmittage mit dem Planen meines
Südinselaufenthaltes verbracht) und brachen bald darauf zum
wunderbaren 4-Tages Trip auf. Und wieder hatte ich großes Glück Tracys
wunderbaren Bruder, dessen Frau und weitere Freunde kennen zu lernen,
bei denen wir das Glück hatten, übernachten zu dürfen. Es war eine
gute Erfahrung, zu sehen, wie viele warmherzige Menschen es auf der
Welt gibt. Besagte Freunde von Tracy waren in ihrer Kindheit, wie
zweite Eltern und somit waren viele Erinnerungen mit dem Besuch und
dem wunderbaren Stück Land, auf dem sie oft spielte (an der
Formulierung ist noch zu arbeiten), Verbunden. An Sommertagen als 13
Jährige spontan auf dem Meer drauf los zu Segeln, das klingt für mich
traumhaft und unvorstellbar.  Auch in anderen Hinsichten haben wir
einen lohnendenTrip verbracht. Das meine ich buchstäblich, denn die
Aussicht war wundervoll und ich durfte aus dem Fenster Gaffen (und
Filmen, Verweis auf Google-Photos) währen Tracy halsbrecherisch im
Kiwistyle fuhr. Um es Kurz zu machen: Wir sind einmal
rundherumgefahren und haben viel gesehen. Dabei habe ich gelernt, dass
Touristenattraktionen einfach lächerlich sind und man schon mit ein
paar wenigen schritten in die Natur für sich selbst und mit guten
Menschen noch viel Schöneres erleben kann. Nun ein gutes hat es dann
doch gehabt: Den Touris am Hot-Water-Beach dabei zuzuschauen, wie sie
sich, Schulter an Schulter stehend, gegenseitig die Sandlöcher
zuschaufeln, war schon mit erheblichen Amusement verbunden. Auch war
der Anblick von Mount Manganui atemberaubend.

Nun bin ich wieder zurück und muss wieder einmal gestehen, das ich
trotz der wunderbaren Reise froh bin, wieder Back-To-Normal zu sein
(was auch immer das beim WWOOOFing bedeuten mag).

Tracy ist weitergezogen, hilft ihrer Schwester beim Einrichten eines
Kindergartens und wird, hinter ihrer Tochter her, nach Asien
(Cambodia, Laos, etc…) reisen. Ich indessen vermisse sie sehr, komme
aber in Genuss jetzt einmal den erfahrenen spielen zu dürfen.

Das bedeutet, dass wir eine neue dänische WWOOFerin haben, mit der ich
mich schon recht gut angefreundet habe. Sie ist Psychologie und
Neure-Sciences Studentin und nimmt sich eine Auszeit vor ihrem
Master-Studium. Nun heist es ihr die Neuseeländischen Verfahrensweisen
näher zu bringen und Erfahrungen weiter zu geben. Ist auf jeden Fall
sehr spannend für beide Seiten.  Es ist erstaunlich, wie gut ich schon
zurechtkomme (immer noch entfernt vom Optimum). Leute kennenlernen, im
Supermarkt oder den Hot Pool mit wild fremden Freundschaften zu
schließen oder auf Mount Manganui mit einem Tschechen ohne großes
Brimborium ins geschpräch zu kommen, all das währe für mich vor einem
halben Jahr wohl noch nicht möglich gewesen. Nun ich hatte wohl keine
Ahnung, worauf ich mich einließ und das bekomme ich auch zu spüren,
aber es lohnt sich. Ich bin nicht frei von Zweifeln, was das WWOOFen
betrifft, aber ich komme immer besser zurecht und es steht mir immer
noch offen etwas anderes zu machen, auch wenn mir der aktuelle Modus
Vivendi sehr gefällt. Merkwürdiger Weise lobt jeder mein
Engisch... nun ja das Lernen einer Fremdsprache ist hier nicht so
selbstverständlich, wie in Deutschland.

Damit gab es mal eine grobe Zusammenfassung und ich Falle ins
Bett. Heute war Markttag und ich bin geschafft. :P

:END:
Frohe Weihnachten euch allen.  Zu guter Letzt hat sich Vorgestern auch
bei mir eine weihnachtliche Stimmung eingestellt. (Auch dank Mamas
Lebkuchenpacket. Danke :P.)

> Und so kaum es, dass Valentin, Sohn des Stefan (Sohn des Otto), über
eine Straße, die das Folk der Neuseeländer zu jener Zeit
State-Highway-One nannten, nach Wellington, der Wohnstätte der Familie
der Robertsons, zog. Aber es kamen im allerlei Sorgen und Zweifel
dabei. Jedoch als er sah, dass die Lande, an denen er vorbeizog, der
Heimat [zunehmend] ähnlich sahen, so wusste er, dass er dem Hause des
Matt und der Edith nahe war. Es ward wie ein Licht in seiner Seele und
er rief aus Halleluja und er pries den Herrn zum Feste der Geburt Jesu
mit Freunden und nicht in Einsamkeit zu sein.

Nach meinem letzten Blogeintrag führte die ganze Situation zu einer
kleinen, mehr oder weniger produktiven, Aussprache mit meinen WWOOFing
Hosts. Um es zusammenzufassen, kann man wohl sagen, dass wir uns wohl
etwas falsch verstanden haben und ich insbesondere die Kritik des
brummigen Hosts wohl etwas zu streng nahm. In der Folge habe ich
versucht, mich nach bestem Willen zu verbessern, war jedoch weiterhin
das Gräuelventil für den überarbeiteten Gerrit. Wilhelmina war jedoch
so freundlich, mir dann doch immer einmal zu signalisieren, dass ich
nicht ganz so schlimm für die beiden bin, wie ich vielleicht
annahm. Auch die, für die Weihnachtszeit angereiste Tochter Kina, trug
zur Entspannung der Hosts, und damit auch zur Entspannung meiner
Situation bei. Schließendlich bin ich dann am 19. Dezember im guten
und mit guten Erinnerungen aufgebrochen, reich beschenkt mir einer
Flasche Olivenöl und einem Glaß Honig.

Aufgebrochen zu einer wunderbar interessanten Reisewoche. Ich, von mir
aus, hätte wohl die letzte Woche vor Weihnachten einfach noch einmal
geWWOOFt und habe es Ediths Aufmunterungen zu verdanken, mich zu einer
kleinen Rundreise über die Ostküste bis zum Tongariro National Park
aufgerafft zu haben. Es brauchte einem arbeitsamen, aber sehr
interessanten, Nachmittag end die Route war ausgeplant und die wurden
Hostels gebucht.

Nach einer langen, aber sehr Pittoresken fahrt um das East Cape, auf
dem der östlichste Leuchtturm der Welt steht und bei dem ich zwei
nette deutsche Radler traf, wurde ich äußerst positiv von meinem
Hostel überrascht. Nich allein waren die Umgebung und die Einrichtung
wunderschön, nein auch bekam ich kostenfrei, aufgrund von
Unterfüllung, ein Einzelzimmer mit Sonnenaufgangsblick, den ich, da
ich ganz ohne Wecker um 5 Uhr am Morgen erwachte, alsbald genießen
durfte. (Um ehrlich zu sein: die Sonne versteckte sich hinter einer
Wolke, war also gar nicht direkt zu erkennen, aber das Farbenspiel war
dennoch sehr ansehnlich.) Am nächsten Morgen war ich bereits auf dem
besten Weg, nach Gisborne weiter zu fahren, kam aber zu meinem Glück,
dass mich wohl die ganze Woche verfolgte, mit einem Schweizer
Radreisenden ins Gespräch. Ich entschied, noch eine Nacht im Hostel zu
verweilen und brach, zusammen mit dem Schweizer, zu einem sehr
lohnenswerten Tagesausflug auf. Der East-Coast scheint sehr beliebt
unter Radfahrern zu sein, sodass es im Hostel neben Anraud auch noch
zwei niederländische- und einen britischen Radfahrer gab. Zurück zum
Faden: Arnaud und ich wanderten also zu Cooks Cove, einer kleinen
Bucht, die Captain Cook bei seiner Umsegelung Neuseelands entdeckt,
und als besonders, außergewöhnlich schön befunden hat. Und auch wir
konnten diesem Urteil nur zustimmen, bot die Bucht doch einen Anblick,
wie ein Photo aus dem Reisemagazin. Sogar im eiskalten Wasser konnten
wir planschen. Danach haben wir uns noch den längsten Anleger in der
östlichen Hemisphere (jaja der Begriff ist inadequat...) angesehen und
durchlaufen. Der besagte Anleger stammt noch aus der Zeit nach dem
Weltkrieg, als man in Neuseeland die Schafe und Rinder zum Hafen trieb
und direkt geschlachtet auf Kühlbote lud, um das verwüstete Europa zu
versorgen. Besonders ausgeprägt war diese Verfahrensweise am
East-Coast, der als ganzer Landzug bis weit ins Inland eine einzige
Farm ist. Es gibt in Neuseeland Siebzig Millionen Kühe, Rinder und
natürlich Schafe auf Viereinhalb Millionen Menschen und trotzdem sind
Milch und Fleisch teuer. Das liegt, wie mir vom sympathischen
Hotelbesitzer erklärt wurde, am wunderbaren, komplett freien
Handelsmarkt in Neuseeland. So verkauft man lieber im Export und wer
im eigenen Lande auch noch etwas abhaben möchte, der Zahlt doch bitte
dieselben hohen Preise. Es gibt hier keine Zuschüsse und keine
Unterstützung, sodass den Farmern nichts anderes übrig bleibt, als
mitzuspielen, um im Geschäft zu bleiben.

Da mir das nicht genug Aktivität für den Tag war und es mir nach
Abenteuer (Querfeldeinmarsch) stand, habe ich am Abend noch den Hügel
hinter dem Hostel erklommen. Mein Ehrgeiz peitschte mich bis zehn
Meter unter den Gipfel, den ich dann aber im Angesicht eines
Geröllhanges zu meiner Linken und Felsblöcken zu meiner Rechten nicht
mit Sandalen an den Füßen beklettern wollte. Auf dem Weg nach Unten
beschloss ich einen scheinbar direkteren Weg zu nehmen, endete im
Dickicht und musste umdrehen, um nach einer anderen Route zu
suchen. So habe ich gelernt: Nimm immer den Weg zurück, den du
gekommen bist. (Denn du weißt, dass er funktioniert.) Aus einem
zwanzigminütigen Spaziergang wurde also eine zwei Stunden
Wanderung. Auch die Blasen, die ich mir in meinen Wanderschuhen beim
Austragen von Werbezettelchen für meine Hosts (30km in zwei Tagen)
gelaufen habe, dankten es mir. Zum Abend kochte ich mit Arnaud ein
paar Nudeln, die wir dann zusammen mit zwei frisch angekommenen und
recht planlosen deutschen Mädels (auf die meisten unserer Fragen gaben
sie dieselbe Antwort: “Wir wissen [es] nicht…”) verspeisten.

Am nächsten Tage ging es schließlich weiter zum Tongariro National
Park. Einen Zwischenstopp machte ich in Gisborne, um mir im dortigen
Park ein wenig die Füße zu vertreten, eine Statue von Captain Cook zu
bewundern und das Östlichste Observatorium der Welt anzusehen (Naja,
eben nur ein kleines weißes Haus mit Kuppel :P.). Im Anschluss daran
durfte ich auf einer Sechsstündigen Fahrt allerhand schöhne Natur
bewundern und legte mich im Hostel nach einem kleinen Abendbrot direkt
Schlafen.

Um fünf Uhr in der Frühe peitschte ich mich am folgenden Tage aus dem
Bett, um das Shuttle zur Tongariro Alpine Crossing zu erwischen. Ja,
auch ich habe mich mal wieder wie ein Tourist benommen und bin die
berühmte 19 Kilometer lange Crossing gewandert. Trotz den, den Blick
versperrender Wolken, habe ich Ansichten genossen, die mich erstaunten
und die wohl in ihrer Unwirklichkeit unvergleichlich mit allem bisher
gesehenem waren. Und trotzdem verspürte ich eine Ambivalenz, fühlte
ich mich doch auf Grund der schieren Massen der anderen Wanderer, die
auf dem Wege vor und hinter mir, mehr oder weniger motiviert
marschierten, sehr gewöhnlich. Nachdem ich den großen Anstieg, der uns
gleich am Anfang erwartete, fast rannte und viele überholt habe,
traute ich mir zu, den, in Wolken verhüllten, Ngauruhoe (Mt. Doom aus
TLOTR) zu besteigen. So machte ich mich, zusammen mit einem
freundlichen Briten, an den Aufstieg. Als sich die Sicht sich dann
aber auf einige Meter beschränkte und ich, in der Aussicht einen
Geröllhang zu erklettern zunehmend die Nerven verlor, beschloss ich
Umzukehren und meine Kräfte für die Verbleibenden 12 Kilometer auf der
Crossing aufzusparen. Derselben Ansicht waren zwei junge Damen, denen
ich für eine Weile der Wanderung anschloss. Gesellschaft ist manchmal
eben doch dem einsamen Vor-sich-hin-grübeln vorzuziehen. Der weitere
verlauf meiner Wanderung lässt sich besser Photographisch beschreiben
und ich verweise hiermit wiedereinmal auf meine Photofreigabe. Nachdem
mich über die letzten Kilometer die Massen, die ich zuvor überholte,
ihrerseits überholten, weil meine mit Blasen übersäten Füße so
furchtbar schmerzten, ging es zurück ins Hostel. Um an Toast zu
sparen, kochte ich mir Pfannkuchen einer Herzhaften und sehr
schmackhaften Füllung und auch am Folgetag fand ich große Freude an
der Kocherei und versuchte meine Vorräte möglichst effizient zu
verkochen (Spiegelei mit der restlichen Füllung und Crêpes als
Toastersatz :P).

Am 23. Dezember erwischte ich die letzten sonnigen und Regenfreien
Stunden, um zu den überaus ansehnlichen Tarnaki Falls zu wandern,
wobei man sowohl die typische Tongariro Steppe (mit Blick auf die
Vulkane), als auch den grünen Native-Bush bewundern
durfte. Witzigerweise waren wir fast genau vor drei Jahren schon
einmal in der Gegen und mir Stand im erstklassigen Museum und Visitor
Centre Vorort ein Deja-Vu bevor. Sowohl die Wanderung als auch das
Visitor Centre befinden sich nahe des Whakapapa Village, eines von
Ski-Enthusiasten gegründeten Feriendorfs mit allerlei Restaurants,
Kaffees und Unterkünften (Unter ihnen auch das berühmte Baudenkmal und
Skihotel Chateau Tongariro, endlich einmal ein Richtiges
Steingebäude!). Aus Neugier fuhr ich zu guter Letzt auch die Straße
zum Skigebiet hinauf, um in Mitten von Nebel, Regen und Wolken
Skilifte und Felsklippen zu bewundern (sehr Surreal).

Das Weuhnachtsfest mit Edith und Familie war sehr harmonisch und
gemütlich, sodass ich es endlich einmal geschafft habe, richtig zu
entspannen. Ich kann mich glücklich schätzen, so reich beschenkt
worden zu sein (Danke Mutti und Papi und Omi und alle anderen
;)!). Auch das Weihnachtsabendessen im ‘München’, einem deutschen
Restaurant, schmeckte überaus gut. (Ich habe irgendwie das Talent,
immer den größten Appetit mitzubringen und die kleinste Portion
abzubekommen. :P)

Am Weihnachtstage dann, ging ich (zum ersten Mal seit Langem) in die
katholische Kirche in Khandallah und musste feststellen, das selbst
ich die Gemeindegemeinschaft doch sehr vermisst habe. Auch die Predigt
des humorvollen Pfarrers zum Thema “Ist Religion eine Ausflucht” (Sie
ist keine, sie ist eine Hilfe … ein mittel gegen Spirituelle Armut …)
war zugegebener Maßen sehr interessant.

Punkt. :) Die nächsten Tage werden hoffentlich sehr entspannt :).

Eine Frohe Weihnacht und vielen Dank für eure Geduld.

Grüße von der Südinsel.

Mit einem Tollen Blick auf das Gebirge im Norden der Südinsel verfasse
ich mal wieder einen kleinen Bericht für euch. Da ich zur Zeit mal
wieder dabei bin, neue Berge zu erklimmen, werde ich mich etwas kürzer
fassen, als es im Anbetracht der seit dem letzten Post vergangenen
Zeit vielleicht zu erwarten wäre.

Nachdem mein Auto, in dem ich klugerweise ein Licht über die Nacht
brennen ließ, nach einer in aller frühe durchgeführten Starthilfe mit
dem fünften Versuch dann doch noch startete, habe die die Fähre zur
Südinsel noch erwischt und bin nach einer langen Tagesreise bei meinem
neuen WWOOFing Host angekommen. Irgendwo im Nirgendwo auf einem
kleinen Hügel liegt ein kleinen Bed and Breakfast, in dem ich nun
einen phänomenalen Ausblick genießen kann. Reg Turner, mein Host, hat
die Idee der Luxus-Lodges überhaupt erst nach Neuseeland gebracht und
sich jetzt hier zur Ruhe gesetzt. Ich nahm, nach meiner letzten
WWOOFing Erfahrung, mit etwas verschobenen Erwartungen auf die
Südinsel, nur um zu erkennen, das Whakatane wohl eine Ausnahme
darstellt. Mit Reg ist es ein ganz anderes Gefühl. Die eigene Arbeit
wird gewürdigt, Initiative begrüßt und vor allem werden Fehler
verziehen.

Ich wohne in einem kleinen Bungalow neben der Lodge und habe die
ersten Nachmittage damit verbracht, denselben ein wenig zu säubern und
herzurichten. Nichts Gravierendes, aber man möchte es ja gern ein
wenig wohnlich haben. Ich genoss also die ersten Tage, allein zu sein
und meinen Bungalow für mich zu haben. Doch bevor ich mich von der
Gesellschaft abnabeln konnte, schneite ein Französischer WWOOFer
herein. Welch ein Glück, denn zu mehreren macht WWOOFen immer mehr
Spaß. Meddy ist Bäcker und buk, zu unserer großen Freude, gleich am
ersten Tag ein wunderbares Brot. Fasziniert von dieser Kunst, bat ich
darum, ich auch einmal an einem Brot versuchen zu dürfen. Gesagt,
getan: Gestern habe ich schon mein drittes Brot gebacken und habe
seitdem ich herausgefunden, wie schön das europäische Brot doch ist,
bisher kein Toastbrot angerührt. Das Brot backen nimmt erstaunlich
viel Zeit in Anspruch, ist aber, aufgrund der kreativen Freiheiten
(Gemüse in’s Brot backen :P), eine sehr interessante
Beschäftigung. Zwei Tage nach Meddys Ankunft waren wir dann schon vier
WWOOFer. Zwei deutsche WWOOFer sind zu uns gestoßen und wir sind nun
eine eifrige Task-Force für den Sommer-Cleanup. Ich selbst habe die
letzten Tage, nachdem zuerst aufgrund des Regenwetters Hausarbeit
angesagt war, die etwas abenteuerlich steile auffahrt mit dem
Weedeater gemäht. Heute dann haben wir die Garage einmal gründlich
aufgeräumt und durchetikettiert.

Erstaunlicherweise habe ich schon am zweiten Tag frei bekommen und
darauf hin versucht Most Stevens zu besteigen. Auf halben Wege zum
Gipfel viel mir dann aber auf, dass ich zwar mein Wasser sehr
vorausschauend aufgefüllt, aber nicht eingepackt hatte. Also kehrte
ich um und das zu meinem Glück, denn der Berggipfel war auf einmal in
bedrohlich dunkle Wolken gehüllt. Auf dem Rückweg motivierte ich dann
noch eine ganze Reihe von Unentschlossenen in das eiskalte Flusswasser
zu springen, indem ich mit gutem Beispiel voran ging. Ein paar Tage
später, wanderte ich zu ein paar Höhlen (Große an Virus und Familie!)
und traf einen amerikanischen Reisenden aus Australien, mit dem ich
mich prächtig über dies und jenes unterhielt und den ich schon bald
als Freund und Seelenbruder gewann. Da ich unmöglich alle Kontaktdaten
meiner überaus glücklichen Begegnungen in Neuseeland festhalten kann,
habe ich jetzt eine neue Datei eröffnen müssen. Erstaunlich, wie viele
tolle Menschen es gibt.

Ich war sehr glücklich als Kyle, so der Name der Wanderbekanntschaft,
mir erzählte, dass ihm im Weka Workshop ähnliches widerfahren ist, wie
mir. Der Wega Workshop, den ich auf einer kleinen Fahrradtour
entdeckte, ist eine tolle Galerie von sehr ansehnlicher
Holzarbeit. Wenn man das Grundstück, auf dem sich diese Ausstellung
befinden soll, betritt, strahlt einem ein großes, rotes Schild: ‘OPEN’
entgegen. Davon eingeladen, fange ich also an durch den Garten, auf
den die Einfahrt führt, zu schlendern und eifrig zu photographisch zu
dokumentieren, wie schön der Ort doch sei. Nach einer Weile kommt dann
der Besitzer zu mir herüber und fragt mich, wer ich denn sei und warum
ich denn einfach so in fremder Leute Gärten herumschlendere. Ganz
perplex antworte ich ehrlich und wenig gewitzt, dass ich wohl von dem
Schild in der Einfahrt verwirrt gewesen sein musste und ich
normalerweise nicht die Gewohnheit Pflege, Grundstücke als öffentlich
zu betrachten. Ich hätte natürlich behaupten können, das der sehr
schön angelegte Garten an sich doch schon ein Kunstwerk oder eine
Gallerie, wie sie auf dem Eingangsschild beworben wurde,
darstellt. Wie auch immer. Der Herr erwiderte dann, dass er nicht
hinter Schildern und Zäunen leben möchte und deshalb seinen Garten
nicht als privat markiert hatte. Warum er dann aber vor sein Haus eine
Kette mit dem Schild ‘Private’ aufgehängt hatte, war mir dann nicht
ganz klar. Vielleicht sind Ketten O.K. oder er hat Spaß daran harmlose
Touristen in die Irre zu führen, die annehmen, das alles was nicht als
Privat gekennzeichnete erlaubt ist. Mit dem schrecken habe ich mir
dann noch die eigentliche Ausstellung angesehen. Interessante Möbel,
von Brettchen, verziert mit kleinen Holzpilzen, über Lampenständer,
bis hin zu verrückten Tischen und Schränken, waren zu bestaunen. Falls
also jemand Interesse an einem schön verzierten Holzlöffel hat, so
melde er sich jetzt!

Auch erwähnenswert ist der Ausflug zum Farewell Spit, den ich und
Meddy unternommen haben. Das Farewell-Spit ist die lange, dünne aus
einem einzigen langen Strand bestehende nördlichste Landzunge der
Nordinsel, die man sogar mit exorbitant teueren Torbussen befahren
kann. Wir sind über die nächstgelegen Hügel gewandert und hatten einen
erstaunlichen Ausblick auf das von einem Sandsturm überholte Spit. Ich
habe an diesem erstaunlich schöne Natur und noch viel schönere Strände
sehen dürfen, muss aber zugeben, das ich selbst in Wellington noch nie
so einen Wind erlebt habe. Der Wind machte alles aber noch viel
interessanter, denn jeder hat Bilder vom Farewell Spit, aber wer hat
schon Bilder von einem Sandsturm auf der Landzunge? Die wandernden
Dünen und blauen Wellen auf dem Whariki-Beach zu betrachten, war auch
eine sehr eindrucksvolle Erfahrung. Gleich zwei Landschaftswahrzeichen
an einem Tag! Abends dann bin ich nach dem Brot Backen dann in mein
Bett gefallen und erst gegen zwölf eingeschlafen.

So weit so gut. Das waren die bisher südlichsten Abenteuer des
Valentin in einer (sehr,) sehr kurzen Fassung.  Danke fürs einschalten
und bis zum nächsten mal liebe Kinder :).

Ein gefiddel ist das mit Gnu Emacs, aber man will ja nicht ewig mit
Apple TextEdit weitermachen. Nachdem ich jetzt final auf Linux
umgestiegen bin, versuche ich nur noch "professionelle" Linux-Hacker
Software zu benutzen. In der Tat hat der Linux Umstieg in letzter Zeit
den größten Teil derselben aufgefressen. Aber nun habe ich mein
schönes Arch Linux Setup und kann dem Herumgetippe endlich ohne
USB-Wlan Dongle und abrupte Systemabstürze frönen.

[Farad fahren. Hechel... Sitz viel zu niedrig, lässt sich aber nicht
auf meine außernormlichen Dimensionen einstellen.]

Nun sitze ich, beschienen von der goldenen Abendsonne, auf einem
Hügeln mit Blick auf den Tahunanui Beach und das unglaublich blaue
Meer. Nach einem sehr interessanten Film im Pseudo-Dokumentarstiel
musste ich mich noch einmal abreagieren und das schöne Wetter
genießen.

Auch meine letzten Tage in Collingwood wahren, wie auch die Wochen
davor, sehr interessant und reich an Schönem. Ich durfte jeden Tag
aufs neue die unglaublich fabülöse Aussicht auf die Berge genießen und
als sei dem nicht schon Freude genug wurde auch meine Arbeit vom
ausgesprochen gutherzigen Reg Turner geschätzt.

Eines Abends fand ich einmal mehr besonderes Verknügen daran, mit dem
ungefederten Farad der Lodge über die ungeteerte Straßen des
Arorere-Valleys zu touren. Ich stürzte mich also die
abeteuerlich-steile Auffahrt herunter, wurde mir unter großem
entsetzen bewusst, dass das Betätigen der Bremsen meine
halsbrecherische Tour nicht nennenswert verlangsamt und so kam ich
dann mit sehr viel ungewollter Mountainbike-Action auch tatsächlich
heil am Ausgangstor an. Und weiter ging es quer Feld (Staubstraße) ein
bis ich irgendwann über eine Brücke mit toller Aussicht bis zum Anfang
der Boulder Lake Wanderwegs radelte. Eigentlich trivial, aber wegen
der schönen Aussicht auf die Berge und das Tal trotzdem
erwähnenswert. Meinen Rückweg meinte ich durch die Wahl einer
Privatstraße verkürzen zu können, hatte aber dabei nicht
einkalkuliert, wie einschüchternd die geballte Neugier von einhundert
Rindviechern sein kann.

Tags darauf wollte ich den Milnthorpe Park besichtigen und entschloss
mich, anstatt des Autos das Farad als Transportmittel zu
wählen. Fleißig deichselte ich nach Collingwood, um einen Brief
abzusenden und sah mir auf dem Weg einen Ausguck und den alten
Friedhof anzusehen. Kurz darauf rutschte mein Hinterrad seitlich auf
der Geröllstraße (Was für eine Deichselarbeit!) weg und ich führte ein
sehr akrobatisches Ballett auf, um bis auf ein paar Schrammen an der
rechten Hand unversehrt zu überleben. Ein paar ruhigere Minuten später
durfte ich dann den Freuden von gut angelegten Spatzierwegen in
schöner Natur und kostenloser Karten freuen, als ich den
schattig-kühlen park erreichte. Nachdem man nicht endemische Bäume in
das Brachland gepflanzt hatte, konnten auf deren 'Ausscheidungen' und
in deren Schatten auch die nativen Pflanzenarten Fuß fassen und in den
letzten 30 Jahren einen ganz ordentlichen Wald entstehen lassen. Auf
einer schönen Bank mitten im Wald las ich dann ein wenig in Utas
Neuseelandbuch, tunkte mich kurz ins kühlende Nass und fuhr zurück
nach Hause. (Wobei es der Kühlung im verrückt-kalten Neuseeland Sommer
nicht immer bedar…) Die letzten Meter bergauf musste ich schieben, um
den Kampf mit Kälte und Hunger zu überstehen. Allein der Gedanke an
das Abendbrot hielt mich auf Kurs und nach vielen mühen wurde die
Hoffnung Wahrheit, sprich, ich aß doppelte Portion und war glücklich.

Am Tage bevor meiner Abreise nach Nelson, beschloss ich um 5 Uhr am
Nachmittag noch eine kleine Wanderung anzutreten. Ich zog auf den
Knuckle-Hill, um die Aussicht noch ein letztes mal genießen zu
können. Dabei verkalkulierte ich mich aber gründlich, nicht nur bei
der Länge der Auffahrt, sondern auch bei der Wanderdauer und erschien
erst um zehn Uhr abends zurück zum Abendessen! Aus einer zwei Stunden
Tour wurde eine fünf stunden Odyssee. Verwirrender weise gab man auf
dem Schild zwar die Entfernung für Hin- und Rückweg, aber nur die
halbe Zeit an!

# Nelson

Gleich zum ersten Tage ein Abenteuer. Nachdem ich ausgepackt hatte,
gingen Cathy Jones, mein neuer Host, und ich einkaufen. Ich war
positiv überrascht, das man mir sogar Pineaplle-Lumps (Yummy)
spendierte. Im verlaufe des Nachmittags ging es aber Cathys Rücken
aber immer schlechter, bis sie kaum noch das Auto besteigen konnte und
somit gab es Takeaways zum Abendbrot und wir fuhren zur Notaufnahme.
Nachdem wir bis 12 Uhr in der Nacht gewartet hatten (ich unter äußerst
spannender Lektüre von
(http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)[http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html])
wurde dann ein weiterer kollabierter Wirbel diagnostiziert, Cathy
bekam Schmerztabletten und es war an mir, den 4x4 nach Hause zu
fahren.

Nach kleinen Ausflügen in die Stadt am Folgetag ging, verbrachte ich
den Samstag mit Edith und Konsorten und mir wurde lecker Abendessen im
Lemongrass Restaurant beschert. Am Sonntag besuchte ich die
Kathedrale, denn ich muss zugeben, dass mir der Gottesdienst sehr gut
zur Gedankenstimulation gereicht und auch die Gemeinde etwas Schönes
ist, wenn man der Heimat so fern, wie ich es bin, ist. (Meine
ausführlichen Gedanken zur Religion schreibe ich aktuell nieder).
Montags dann wanderte ich im Zealandia-Clon in der Nähe von Nelson und
durfte ganze 3! unüberückte Bäche durchwaten. Eine sehr spannende
Erfahrung, besonders, wenn das Wasser dermaßen kalt ist! Abends
beglückte ich Carl dann bei Alex und Pauline mit einer kleinen
Spiel-Session, nachdem er sich über die gesamte Weihnachtszeit über
einen Mangel an Zuwendung meinerseits beschwert hatte. Finalement gab
es ein wunderbares BBQ mit deutschen Würsten vom Markt.

So viel Frischluft, wie in Neuseeland hatte ich wahrscheinlich noch
nie, denn nicht nur arbeite ich meist draußen, sondern ich wandere
auch des öfteren unter der Woche. So bestieg ich auch Vorgestern einen
Hügel mit phänomenaler Aussicht über Nelson. Gestern dann war ich in
Indoor Stimmung und so gingen Cathy und Ich ins Kino, um 'Operation
Avalanche', zu sehen. (Siehe Anfang des Posts...)

Cathy ist ein wunderbarer Host und wir schätzen uns beide sehr. So ist
es schade, dass ich nächste Woche schon wieder weiterziehe, aber wozu
bin ich denn sonst in Neuseeland?

Ich sehe viel und erforsche die Umgebung. Dennoch ist es jedes mal
aufs neue eine Schwierigkeit, sich umzustellen. Mittlerweile geht es
aber immer einfacher über die Bühne und ich kann auch in andere
Richtungen denken.

So schwenkte mein Interesse in letzter Zeit auf das Programmieren und
den Computer im Allgemeinen um. In den letzten zwei Wochen habe ich
meiner Meinung nach sehr tiefe Einsichten gewonnen und verstehe nun
endlich in allen Dimensionen wozu ein Betriebssystem überhaupt da ist.
Mal sehen, wohin und wozu mich das führt …

Bis dahin alles Gute Amigos!

Zumindest einen kleinen Bericht bin ich euch schuldig.

Meine verbleibenden Tage in Nelson waren wunderbar und wieder empfinde
ich gro�e Dankbarkeit, wahr Cathy Jones doch wieder so gut zu mir.
Wenn man in der Gegend ist, dann gilt es unter Reisenden schon fast
als Sakrileg, den Abel Tasman National Park nicht zu bewandern. Da ich
ein Greenhorn bin, habe ich mich einmal mehr für die Tagestour
entschieden. Also stehe ich pünktlich um 6:30 Uhr auf, um dann 9 Uhr
gerade noch mit guter Not das Wassertaxi zu erreichen. Allein die
Schiffsfahrt lohnte schon des Ausflugs. Mit einem Affenzahn ging es
zuerst auf eine kleine Exkursion zum Split-Apple Rock, einem in der
Mitte gespaltenen, aus dem Wasser ragenden, kugelförmigen und sehr
apfelähnlichen Felsbrocken, und danach durch diverse Buchten, bis ich
in der Torrent Bay aussteigen durfte. Unter anderem gab es auch
Neuseeländische Pelzrobben zu bestaunen. Meine Sorge, der Wanderweg
würde von den Horden in den Booten (die Wassertaxis wahren bis auf den
letzten Platz besetzt) überrannt werden, wurde zuerst von mir
genommen, als ich erfuhr, dass alle Fahrgäste au�er mir selbst bis
ganz zum Anfang des Wanderweges Fahren (ich mache ja nur eine
Tagestour). Einige Minuten später ging mir dann auf, dass die Bote
schon seit Tagen Hochkonjunktur feierten und ich mich beim Wandern
einer reichlichen Gesellschaft erfreuen durfte.  Und doch, war es wie
im Paradies (und das Optische ist ja ausreichend photographisch
dokumentiert und bedarf keiner weiteren Erläuterung). Alle
Traumstrände wahren wie leergefegt. Kein Mensch, keine Robbe, keine
Sandfly. Alle Welt wandelte auf den Wegen, denn zum Baden gab es zu
viel ... .... naaa .... Niederschlag! (Wer ist jetzt in poetischer
Stimmung?)  Immer munter zog ich also ohne Angst vor Sonnenbrand unter
dem schützenden Wolkendach daher und lie� den Regen hinter mir. (Als
ich einmal den Fehler machte, hinter mich zu schauen, jagte mir eine
graue Regenwand einen Mordsschrecken ein!).  So wnaderte ich also für
meine ersten sechs Kilometer fröhlich vor mich hin, bestaunte und
entspannte. Plötzlich deutet eine Dame von durchaus seriöser
Erscheinung auf den nächstgelegenen Felsbrocken und erklärt mir, das
ich da einen Dinosaurier sehen könne. Bevor ich antworten kann, fährt
sie fort, dass man weiter unten am Hügel noch einen Waal erkennen
könne und generell die ganze Küste aus allerlei Versteinertem
bestehe. Ich, der ich immer noch glaube, es gehe nur um visuelle
�hnlichkeiten, möchte gerade einräumen, dass der zuerst erwähnte
Felsbrocken für mich wie ein Fisch aussehe, als mir die Dame mit
�berzeugung entgegnet, dass sie auf der Bootsfahrt (nicht auf meinem
Bot...) Knochenstaub auf den Fü�en hatte und nur Dinosaurier und Wale,
nicht aber Fische dieselben aufweisen. Danach wünscht sie mir einen
schönen Tag und zieht schnurstrachs von dannen. Ich bin mir immer noch
nicht ganz sicher, ob irgendeine Art Spa� mit mir getrieben wurde,
hätte aber gern entgegnet, dass sich für allerlei unverstandene Dinge,
allerlei mehr oder weniger plausible Erklärungen finden lassen
können. Ich weis immer noch nicht, was ich davon halten
soll. Vielleicht sollte mir das zeigen, dass jeder, der nur genügend
Selbstbewusstsein besitzt, den grö�ten Humbug von sich geben, dabei
aber immer überzeugend und seriös erscheinen kann.

Nach meiner Mittagspause fühlte ich mich miserabel und begann daran zu
zweifeln, das ich, wenn ich mich nach schon 6 Kilometern so schlapp
bin, die restlichen 14 noch schaffen kann. Zwei Kilometer später wies
auf einmal ein kleiner Wegweiser auf eine kurze Abzweigung (500m) zu
Cleopatras Pool hin. Keine zwei Kilometer, wie ich irrtümlicherweise
in meine Gratis-Karte hineininterpretiert hatte. Eine echte Gumpe, in
Korsika Qualität: Phänomenal und dann zeigt sich auch, zum einzigen
mal an diesem Tag, der Sonnenschein. Nichts wie ... ... in's Wasser
(ätsch, schon wieder nicht gereimt). Wirklich kalt, aber ebenso
erfrischend! Nach dieser kleinen Planscherei, verging der Rest der
Wanderung durch die fast schon monotone Schönheit des Abel Tasman
Parks wie im Fluge.  Zum Abendbrot gab es nach einer, durch enorme
Nachfrage bedingten, halbstündigen Wartezeit einen überaus
bemerkenswert schmackhaften Burger aus dem Fat-Tui Food-Truck.

An meinem letzten Tag in Nelson war ich noch einmal in der Suter Art
Gallery und habe wieder nur einen Raum geschafft, weil man schon um
4:30 Uhr schlie�t! Auf der Suche nach einer neuen Mechanik für meinen
Bass bin ich dreifach am Musikladen vorbeigefahren. Danach schien mir
das Glück hold zu sein, so gab es Tatsächlich einzelne Mechaniken zu
kaufen. Aber immer waren die Tuner für die falsche Seite, aus welchen
Ecken der Verkäufer Sie auch hervorzauberte (und der dieser Ecken gab
es viele). Danach bin ich aus Zufall noch einem Schild zum "Center of
New Zealand" gefolgt und hatte einen tollen Ausblick auf Nelson und
das quietschblaue Meer.

Jetzt bin ich am Westcoast und schreibe diesen Blogpost im gemütlichen
Sofa des netten Hosts. Ich wohne hier einmal mehr irgendwo im
Nirgendwo und wir haben nur Solarstrom und Regenwasser. 'Nur' ist
vielleicht zu kurz getreten, denn wir kommen damit ohne gro�e
Limitierungen über die Runden und ich bin erstaunt, wie wenig
Solarpaneele er auf dem Dach hat.  Schon an meinem ersten Tag wurde
mir eröffnet, dass man (John, der Host, sein Freund Michael und die 3
anderen WWOOFer) am Wochenende einen Campingausflug in die Berge
antreten wollte, um den Weg mit Sägen und Scheren wieder gangbar zu
machen aund zu markieren. Hurra ... soll ich jetzt in Freude oder
Angst ausbrechen? Ich habe noch nie in der Natur gecampt ... will ich
diese Erfahrung überhaupt machen? Ich nahm die Herausforderung an und
so ging es 5:30 in der Frühe los und ab in den Bush! Motivierende
Sprüche wie: "Das Gefühl Durst zu haben ist nichts schlimmes" (im
Angesicht unserer begrenzten Wasservorräte) brachten uns schon einmal
in die rechte Stimmung :).

Zusammenfassend ausgedrückt muss ich eingestehen, dass der Trip
schrecklich grausam, aber lehrreich und eine tolle, besser nicht zu
Wiederhohlende Erfahrung war. Selbst der "professionelle" und
abgehärtete Host John, der als Arzt schon in Afganistan und am Südpol
war, musste zugeben, dass der Trip wohl eher "extrem" war. Im Grunde
sind wir zwei Tage lang klitschnass einen Berg hinauf (leider nicht
ganz bis zum Gipfel) und danach eben wieder hinab gestiegen. Dabei
hatten John und Michael den Zustand des Tracks an beiden Tagen etwas
sehr optimistisch eingeschätzt. Da meine Regenjacke leider nicht
wasserdicht war und ich zu wenig Wechselsachen eingepackt hatte, war
ich wohl aber wohl eher selbst an meinem Unglück schuld. Der sonnige
Abend auf einem Hügel auf halben Weg bergauf (unserer "Camp-Site")
belohnte die Mühe mit tollen Ausblicken, **Trockenheit** und einem
gewissen Siegesgefühl.

Während der letzten Tage habe ich den Westcoast auf weniger
dramatische Weise erforscht und sehr viel Schönes gesehen. Die Fotos
werden folgen, sobald ich wieder eine gute Internetverbindung habe.

Bis dahin: Alles Gute und danke für's lesen.

So vieles habe ich erlebt. Um nicht gleich im Angesicht der
Niederschrift meiner Erlebnisse zusammenzubrechen, teile ich meinen
Post in kleinere, auch für den Leser angenehmere Stücke auf.  So folgt
auch gleich:

****  Erster Teil: West nach Ost
Nach eineinhalb sehr interessanten Wochen nahe Westport,
ward es einmal mehr an der Zeit das Heft in die Hand zu nehmen und
weiterzuziehen. Da mein Host und ich in mancherlei Hinsicht nicht ganz
auf einer Wellenlänge wahren, waren wir beide Glücklich, dass sich
zwei neue WWOOFer ankündigten und er somit einen einigermaßen
höflichen Grund gefunden hatte, mich vorzeitig fortzuschicken. Wie
tief das Problem lag, wurde mir dann erst wirklich bewusst, als ich
ein wunderbar übertriebenes Review auf meinem WWOOFing Profil
bestaunen durfte, indem zwar ein wahrer Kern, aber auch viel Falsches
und, soweit ich es Beurteilen kann, eine blanke Lüge steckt. Trotzdem
erschien mir mein Host als ehrlicher und auch umgänglicher Mensch und
es fällt mir schwer, diese, seine Reaktion zu verstehen. Kultivierte
Unzufriedenheit führt oft zu irrationalem Verhalten und das auf beiden
Seiten. Vielleicht dachte John, er müsste die Gemeinschaft der
WWOOFing Hosts vor einer so schrecklichen Gefahr, wie ich sie in
seinen Augen für den ehrlichen Arbeitgeber darstelle, warnen. Ich für
meinen Teil hatte einen deftigen Kratzer im Lack. Meine aktuellen
Hosts schätzen meine Arbeit aber sehr und siehe da: Die Welt sieht
schon viel Besser aus.

Wo ich schon einmal über vier freie Tage verfügte und es eine recht
weite Strecke bis zu meinem nächsten Ziel (Christchurch) war, lag es
nahe, die Zeit reisend (im touristischen Sinne) zu verbringen. Nach
anfänglichem Regenguss, verbesserte sich die Lage in Punakaiki zu
einem Grauen aber Regenfreien Regen. Mit einem deutschen Hichthiker,
den ich auf dem Wege eingesammelt hatte, spazierte ich um die
sagenumwobenen Pancacke Rocks. Ein echter Touristenfang und dazu noch
ein recht Schöner. Aber im Angesicht von geteerten Wanderwegen und
Menschenmassen, deren Autos den Parkplatz selbst an einem Regentag mit
Leichtigkeit blockieren, erkannte ich wieder einmal, welch ein Glück
ich habe, kein Tourist zu sein.

Mit dem letzten Liter Benzin und einer leuchtenden Warnanzeige
schafften wir es zuletzt noch nach Greymouth, die größte Stadt am
Westcoast und der Standort der ersten Tankstelle (Tankstellen: Plural!
Welch eine Dekadenz!) in 100 Kilometern. Greymouth wirkt auf den
ersten Blick wie Stephen Kings Derry und auch auf den zweiten Blick
und erst recht auf den Dritten. Dennoch konnte ich bei klärendem
Himmel einen schönen Spatziergang an der kilometerlangen Flutmauer,
hin zum (sehr) kleinen Greymouth-Museum unternehmen. Als Bergbaustadt
kann man in Greymouth allerlei Gerät und sogar einen (ehemaligen?)
Hafen bestaunen. Das Museum erzähl viele kleine und interessante
Geschichten, unterfüttert mit allerlei Fotographie.

> Da gab es einen Unternehmer, der das schnellste Dampfschiff
Neuseelands besaß. Eines Tages lief sein Schiff auf Grund und wurde
damit, um Strafzahlungen zu vermeiden, automatisch Eigentum der Stadt
Greymouth. Das Wrack wurde alsbald durch einen Mittelsmann günstig
zurück ersteigert (... wer will schon ein Schiff kaufen, dass selbst
der ehemalige stolze Besitzer nicht mehr haben möchte ...) und der
Antrieb in ein großes ehemaliges Segelschiff verpflanzt. Das neue
Schiff dampfte mit demselben Motor, aber einem vielfachen an
Frachtkapazität, immer noch mit fast derselben Geschwindigkeit seines
Vorgängers und damit weitaus schneller, als all seine Konkurrenten.

In einem Hinterzimmer fand sich eine komplette Sammlung aller National
Geographic Heften seit den 70igern und mir stach sofort eine Ausgabe
aus den späteren 80igern ins Auge. Eine recht amüsante Lektüre, aus
einer Zeit, in der Computergrafik noch ganz neu, primitiv und
unglaublich spannend war. Ich bin heute so sehr an die Wunder des
Computers gewöhnt, dass mir diese neue Perspektive eine kleine
Erleuchtung bescherte.

Stahlgraue Wellen und silberne Kieselstrände. Palmen und
Flaxbüsche. Im südlichsten subtropischen Bush Neuseelands beschloss
ich den Tag auf einer kleinen Wanderung. Der Queens Point Lookout bot
mir einen überwältigenden Ausblick auf ein Meer aus Flax, das auf
einem geradezu geometrisch abfallenden Kliff in Zerfurchte Felsen und
schließlich in den Ozean übergeht.

Ein weiter Pluspunkt für Greymouth ist das hervorragende Global
Village Hostel, das mit gemütlichen Betten, kostenlosen Kajaks und
allerhand anderen Extras besticht. Die Küche in zunehmendes Chaos
versetzend, verbrachte ich den Abend mit der Zubereitung einer frei
erfundenen Pasta-Sauce (mit echten Tomaten, nicht aus dem Glas!) und
verschätzte mich dermaßen in der Quantität, dass ich mir die Kocherei
am nächsten Tag sparen konnte. An der Qualität allerdings, gab es
nichts auszusetzen.

So kommen ein ereignisreicher Tag und ein kurzer Blogpost zu einem
Ende

*Es folgt: "Berge"*.

Gehabt euch gut.

Ein nächster Tag auf Reisen. Dieses mal in die Berge. Nach
unschuldiger Fahrt durch ein Flachland um Greymouth, eröffnet sich
plötzlich ein unerwartet beeindruckender Anblick und ich drücke auf
die Bremse, damit mir die Sicht nicht so schnell wieder vom Bush
verschluckt wird. Von einer kleiner Anhöhe aus erstreckte sich einmal
mehr ein Flachland, dass sich als bald jedoch in ein echtes Tal
überging, umflankt von Wendelsteinen. Es waren bei weitem nicht meine
ersten Berge auf der Südinsel, doch vielleicht die schönsten. Jeder
kennt die besondere Mächtigkeit der Berge.

Zusammen mit 100 Lastwagen, die allesamt schneller vorankamen als mein
grüner Demio, hatte ich noch eine Interessante und beeindruckende
Fahrt über Brücken und durch halboffene Tunnel.  Unter wechselhaftem
Wolken, die mir mal Regenschauer und mal Sonne bescherten, kletterte
ich in kurzen Hosen und mit gegen den Wind modifizierten Sonnenhut
(umgedreht und die Krempen mit dem Halteband über meine Ohren
gebunden) hinauf zum Temple Basin Ski Field, bei dessen Anblick sich
mir die Natur der neuseeländischen Skifahrer bewusst wurde. Steile
Hänge, endend in Furchen und Wasserfällen. Und auch schneebedeckte
Gipfel boten sich mir auf der anderen Seite des Tales da. Und es ward
windig, es ward kalt und Valentin stieg hinab ins Tal geschwindig oder
er ward nicht mehr alt.

Zum Abend ging es weiter ins Arthurs Pass Village zur Übernachtung im
"The Sanctuary" Hostel. Zugegeben, das Hostel war _sehr_ Basic, nicht
mehr als eine Tramping Hütte mit einer Küche und, Gott sei Dank, einer
Heizung, aber die Leute waren nett. Unter ihnen auch ein deutscher
Informatiker, mit dem ich im Dunkeln noch zu ein paar beleuchteten
Wasserfällen spazierte.

Der besitzer des Hostels war auch ein lustiger Kauz, mit einem
Kajakverlei in Lyttleton bei Christchurch. Bezahlt wird im Hostel über
eine Vertrauenskasse, wenn er absent ist :).  Müde ward ich und so
ging es zu Bett. Am nächsten Morgen folgten: _Mehr Berge_ .

Welch Turbulenzen! Eddies und wirbel haben den Blog ganz aus meinem
Geiste geblasen! Jetzt ist es aber h?chste Eisenbahn, die n?chste
Fortsetzung zu schreiben. Also dann mal ran an den Speck.

Wo wahren wir stehen geblieben ...

Endlich einmal hatte ich das Verg?gen, meinen Schlafsack auch einmal
sinnvoll zu nutzen und wirklich, das Geld hat sich gelohnt und ich kam
warm durch eine recht k?hle Nacht. Am n?chsten Morgen war ich einmal
mehr dabei, meine sieben (acht) Sachen zusammenzusuchen und weiter zu
fahren, als, es kommt uns bekannt vor, ich mit einem netten, deutschen
Informatiker ins Gespr?ch kam. Wir hatten schon am vorherigen Abend
zusammen eine kleine Exkursion zu ein paar beleuchteten Wasserf?llen
unternommen und wollten jetzt eine kleine drei-stunden Wanderung auf
dem Arthur's Pass Walkway angehen. Frisch und munter ?chzten wir
dahin, als wir, emp?rt ?ber unserer beider Kondition, ein paar stufen
zu einem weiteren Wasserfall emporkletterten. Der Wasserf?lle gibt es
viele in Neuseeland, fast zu viele, als dass man sie w?rdigen k?nnte,
aber an Gr??e konnte bisher keiner mit dem vor uns dahin rauschenden
Exemplar mithalten! Weiter ging es mit allerhand Abstechern, bis wir
zu einer kleinen Br?cke gelangten, nach der der Weg nur noch f?r
"Mountaineers" (Bergsteiger) geeignet war. Und w?hrend all dem gab es
eine so wunderbare Szenerie. Jeder Berg hat seine Eigenheiten, mit
unter sogar eine andere Vegetation und geht man nur ein paar Minuten
voran, hat man wieder eine v?llig andere Perspektive und kann sich auf
ein Neues sattsehen. Auf dem R?ckweg qu?lte ich mich ein bisschen, da
ich in der Erwartung, nur sechs Kilometer zu laufen, keine Verpflegung
mitgenommen hatte! Zur?ck im Hostel st?rzte ich mich nach dieser 16
Kilometerwanderung auf meinen Vorrat an K?se und
Supermarkt-Baguette. Alles schmeckt delicieus, wenn man nur gen?gend
Hunger hat.

Nach einer kleinen Ruhepause ging es ab nach Christchurch. Ich hatte
Schwierigkeiten meine Konzentration auf die Stra?e bei solch einer
Szenerie aufrecht zu erhalten. Ein paar Anblicke mit kahlen Bergen,
die wie gigantische Sand- und Schutthaufen aussahen, erinnerten sogar
an Ronneburg vor der Bundes-Gartenschau :P.

Auf dem Wege wollte ich mir noch den ber?hmten Castle-Rock mit seinen
Steinformationen ansehen und folgte brav dem Navi, dass mich dann aber
in ein Feriendorf ohne erkennbaren Zugang zum H?gel lotzte. Entt?uscht
fuhr ich vondannen, nur um f?nf Minuten sp?ter und voller Freude den
richtigen Parkplatz zu entdecken. Der Farmer, der das umliegende Land
sein eigen nennt, hatte nicht an Warnschildern und Draht gespart,
sodass man sich fragte, ob er nun Touristen oder Rinder einz?unt.

Der Castle-Rock selbst sieht aus, wie eine Cyberpunk Steinstadt oder
das Gebiss eines Riesens und konnte mich, selbst nach all dem in
Neuseeland gesehenen, noch erfreulich ?berraschen. Reichlich
beeindruckt von meinem Tag legte ich auch die letzten Kilometer nach
Christchurch zur?ck.

Das Hostel, in dem ich die Nacht verbrachte, kann ich wohl getrost zu
meinen Favoriten z?hlen. Klein aber fein und sehr gem?tlich. So
freundete ich mich auch gleich mit einer sympathischen Amerikanerin an
und wir erz?hlten so ?ber dies und jenes. Ihr R?ckflug nach Amerika
ging ?ber ein von Trumps Travel-Ban betroffenes Land, dessen Konsulat
freundlicherweise ein Schreiben an ihre Airline verfasste, da diese
ihren Flug nicht umbuchen wollte.

Ein Tag mit noch gr??eren Erlebnissen als der letzte!

Danke f?r's mitmachen! Schalten Sie auch morgen wieder ein, denn es
folgt: Christchurch.

Äonen lang schrieb er nichts und ward vergessen.

Doch nun ist er zurück und beginnt den Post gleich hochmotiviert mit
einem Umlaut: **Funky :)**.  In all den besagten Äonen gab es genug
Zeit, um reichlich neue Erfahrungen zu sammeln, so werde ich, um die
Geduld des Lesenden nicht zu sehr zu strapazieren, einen gröberen
Überblick geben.

Ich habe das letzte Mal vergessen zu erwähnen, das mir während der
Fahrt von Arthurs Pass nach Christchurch ein sonderliches Phänomen der
Atmosphäre ins Auge viel: Eine breite, dichte und tief schwarze
Wolkenfront. Ein dunkler Horizont lag vor mir und ich machte mich auf
ein erstaunliches Gewitter gefasst. Einige Kilometer später jedoch,
musste ich meine Belüftung kurzzeitig auf Innenluft umschalten, da das
vermeintlich meteorologische Phänomen eines gewaltigen Waldbrandes mit
allen Manieren inklusive des Geruchs in den Port-Hills entsprang.

In Christchurch selbst war aber außer der Wolke nichts zu sehen und zu
bemerken. So hatte ich einen wunderbaren Tag im beeindruckend schönen
Christchurch. Ich denke, ich habe bewusst nur die schönen Dinge
wahrgenommen und dennoch kann ich nicht verstehen, das Christchurch so
wenig geschätzt wird. Am morgen hatte ich eine nette Studentin aus
meinem Hostel zur Universität gefahren und so hatten wir uns auch
gleich für die Christchurch Gondola verabredet. Während Sie sich also
in der Universität einschrieb, spielte ich Tourist und ließ mich von
den botanischen Gärten und der Innenstadt erfreuen. Besonders der
kleine Strom "Avon" und das neu entstandene Earthquake-Memorial
beeindruckten mich sehr.  Zum späten Nachmittag durfte ich schließlich
einen phänomenalen Ausblick von der Christchurch Gondola- und im
dazughörigen Restaurant ein Stück Käsekiuchen genießen.

Noch im Schatten meiner letzten WWOOFing Erfahrung versuchte ich,
durch Pünktlichkeit einen guten Eindruck bei meinen nächsten Hosts zu
machen. Allerdings hatte ich nicht wirklich mit der phänomenalen
Verkehrslage in Christchurch gerechnet und so kam ich eine halbe
Stunde zu spät. Anscheinend wurde das aber schon erwartet und so hatte
ich einen herzlichen und entspannten Start mit Martyn (meinem
Host). Auch Sue (dessen Gattin) war und ist Herzensgut, auch wenn Sie
mich mit ihrer Direktheit zu Anfang etwas erschreckte. Da ich immer
noch Probleme mit meinem Handgelenk hatte trug ich zum Autofahren als
meine Handgelenkstütze, die dann gleich als Beeinträchtigung meiner
Arbeitseffizienz gefürchtet wurde :P. Martyn versuchte zu schlichten,
aber Sue meinte, Ich wäre unfair gewesen, Sie nicht über meinen
Gesundheitszustand aufgeklärt zu haben. Nach meiner ehrlichen
Entschuldigung, hatte ich mir doch wirklich nichts in dieser Hinsicht
gedacht, und einer guten Arbeitsleistung am Folgetag war das Problem
dann vergessen.

Damit sehen wir uns Morgen auf der *Banks Peninsula* wieder.

Welch turbulente Tage.  Nach einer großen Panik, die sich bei mir
schon das ganze Wochenende mit einem Unwohlsein angekündigt hat, sitze
ich jetzt auf der Rückbank unseres sehr kleinen Campervans und habe
ein wenig Ruhe, um endlich mal wieder von meinen Abenteuern zu
berichten. Die erste Nacht ist erstaunlich komfortabel überstanden und
ich bin wieder entspannt :).

Den letzten Monat habe ich noch einmal etwas Neues ausprobiert und
mich ins kalte Wasser gestürzt. Und wirklich, ich habe mich am ersten
Abend gefragt, was ich mir eigentlich gedacht habe. Harsch enttäuscht
von Dunedin und überwältigt von der Aussicht, einen Monat einmal ganz
für mich allein zu sorgen, sah ich am ersten Abend wirklich kein
Licht. Ein paar Tage später war meine "Reisekrankheit" aber auch schon
wieder kuriert. Ich hatte mich in Hogwartz, dem Hostel in dem ich
arbeitete, eingelebt und auch mit meiner Programmierarbeit ging es
voran. Zu meinen Kollegen im Hostel konnte ich zuerst keinen Draht
finden und besonders Lukas, ein Musiker und Programmierer, gab sich
sehr verschlossen. Ich fand jedoch recht schnell heraus, dass jeder,
außer einem Langzeitgast des Hostels, dasselbe Problem hatte und
knüpfte darauf hin schnell Freundschaften mit zwei Belgierinnen. Im
Allgemeinen war ich überrascht, wie gesselig ich mich auf einmal in
der Flut der neuen Menschen, die jeden Tag über mich hereinbrach,
verhielt. So unternahm ich regelmäßig Ausflüge und immer fand sich
genug Gesellschaft, um mein Auto zu füllen. Es gibt diesen ganz
bestimmten schlag von jungen Reisenden, die sich immer mit uns (der
Belegschaft) in der kleinen und meist übersehenden Küche neben der
Großküche zusammenfanden und mit denen man immer prächtig auskam. In
besagter Küche, die ich auf Grund ihrer geringen Popularität immer
ganz für mich selbst hatte, konnte ich nach Herzenslust Kochen, Braten
und Backen, ohne mich in Rivalitäten um Töpfe und Herdplatten zu
verstricken. Auch wenn ich zuvor schon gelegentlich ein paar Nudeln
eingeweicht und Fertiggerichte nach Anleitung zubereitet hatte, konnte
ich nicht auf einen großen Erfahrungsschatz zurückblicken. Es sei mir
das Eigenlob vergeben, aber ich meine, mich sehr gut geschlagen zu
haben. Von Bolognese über gebackene Kumara bis hin zur Lasagne hatte
ich nicht unter Nahrungsmangel zu leiden. Und im Kühlschrank stapelte
sich das im ersten Einkauf erstandene Toastbrot, denn gleich an meinem
ersten Tag hatte ich wieder angefangen Brot zu backen. In Wirklichkeit
ist Brotbacken ziemlich einfach, aber sehr lohnend und schindet
deswegen nur umso mehr Eindruck. Fleißig teilte ich mein Brot und mein
Wissen, war aber der Einzige, der bis zum Ende alle halbe Woche Brot
buk.

Welch bemerkenswerte Phänomene durfte ich in unserem kleinen
(mittelgroße) Hostel beobachten. Wenn man sieben Uhr aufstand, hatte
man das ganze Hostel für sich, um acht konnte man den Schleier der
Trägheit noch förmlich sehen und in meinem sehr dunklen aber
gemütlichen Schlafzimmer konnte ich des Öfteren selbst um zehn Uhr
nicht staubsaugen, weil einige besonders bequeme Individuen, immer
noch in ihren Betten ruhten.  Reisende sind ein lustiges Volk,
besonders die Sorte, die mehrere Monate unterwegs ist. Hört man die
Geschichten eines solchen Weltenbummlers, so kann man sich kaum
vorstellen, wie auf Reisen auch nur ein Tag ohne neue, atemberaubende
und phänomenale Eindrücke vergehen kann. In Wirklichkeit kam mir der
Eindruck, das die meisten Tage solcher Menschen von an Lethargie
grenzender Trägheit gekennzeichnet sind. Relativierend muss ich aber
gestehen, dass dieser Eindruck wahrscheinlich von Extremfällen
herrührt, die am Ende der Saison nicht mehr mit der alten Energie
umherziehen. Ich selbst hatte, da man erst um 10 Uhr zur Arbeit
antrat, alle mühe, meinen Schlafrhythmus aufrecht zu erhalten.

Wie dem auch sei. Besonders ein besonders bemerkenswertes Exemplar des
Homo Instrenuus wurde mir zu einem guten Freund, auch wenn ich ihren
Namen immer noch nicht kenne. Sie, eine Chinesin, entfloh dem Stress,
kahm für ein Jahr nach Neuseeland und blieb dann irgendwie in Dunedin
hängengeblieben. Auch wenn ihre Ansichten zur "Partei" sehr chinesisch
sind, war sie doch als biertrinkender Fußballfan so ganz und gar
untypisch.  Ich konnte ihr, die sie ihren Lebtag noch kein Saxophon
gesehen oder gar gehört hatte, mit meinem Saxophonspiel eine große
Freude machen. Das ging soweit, dass ich eines Abends, nachdem wir in
einem sehr schönen Café namens "The Dog with two Tails" (Sehr
untypisch wollte Sie mir unbedingt einen Drink ausgeben. Ich habe das
Bier probiert, konnte aber immer noch nichts daran finden.) waren,
mitten im nächtlichen Stadtzentrum herumjazzte. Nachdem wir eines
anderen Abends zum beeindruckend kunstvollen Choral Evensong in der
wunderbar hellen neogotischen Kathedrale gepilgert waren, fragte
erstaunte ich Sie mit meiner Ansicht, das Reich Gottes würde niemals
kommen. Nicht, dass ich der Menschheit besonders zynisch
gegenüberstehe, aber es ist so, dass sich Religion über das Streben
zum besseren definiert. Ohne dieses Streben verlören die Menschen
recht schnell die Motivation ihr Paradies aufrecht zu
erhalten. Vielleicht ist es also besser wenn, zumindest für die
jetzigen Menschen, das Reich Gottes unerreichbar bleibt. Wir leben in
interessanten Zeiten, in denen Religion teilweise an Signifikanz
verliert und wir Chancen haben, Religion ohne Autorität und Zwang in
ihren guten Seiten zu entdecken. Die Tage der Chinesin entwickeln sich
zu einem Rhytmus von besorgniserregender Abnormalität und ich hoffe,
dass Sie sich selbst etwas Gutes tut und weitergezogen ist, wenn wir
wieder in Dunedin sind.

Auch wenn man sich nach fünf Tagen Toilettenputzen entsprechend
motiviert fühlt, war die Hostel Arbeit, wenn auch keine angenehme,
aber doch eine interessante Angelegenheit. Abendliche Jammsessions,
komfortable Betten, nette Besitzer und eine gemütliche Atmosphäre
machten mir das Hostel zu einem hervorragenden Heim. Als ich dann auch
noch ein (sehr klappriges) Fahrrad leihen durfte, mit dem ich zum
Arbeiten (Programmieren) in die schmucke und sehr ruhige
Universitätsbibliothek fahren konnte, war mein Glück Perfekt. Am
ersten Tage mit dem Fahrad habe ich das Fliegen und meinen Schutzengel
kennengelernt! Wie immer grub ich mir selbst ein paar löcher und
grämte mich des Öfteren, sodass mir erst, als ich die letzten Tage in
einem nicht so angenehmen Hostel verbrachte, bewusst wurde, wie gut
ich es hatte und welche Erfahrung ich gesammelt habe. Auch mein
Programmierjob brachte mir einen unermesslichen Schatz an Erfahrung,
der mir jetzt ermöglicht an einer Open-Source Planetariumssoftware
mitzuwirken. Schon auf der Banks Peninsula habe ich Grundsteine
gelegt, fleißig C++ gebüffelt und mich in QT geübt.

Sehr schöne drei Wochen wahren das. Wenn wir nicht gerade **in** den
Wolken lagen (Ich wollte schon immer mal wissen, wie das ist :P, aber
man wird dem Nebel schnell überdrüssig.), hatten wir eine wunderbare
Sonne und ich konnte sogar ein paar mal vom Anleger aus in die kühle
und tropisch blaue See hüpfen. Auf unserem Hügel sah ich
Sonnenuntergänge und genoss so manchen Tee auf der Veranda. Noch nie
war ich so glücklich über mein Auto, denn ohne ist man auf der
Halbinsel verloren. James Cook hielt den ehemaligen Vulkan sogar für
eine Insel und taufte Sie, nach seinem Bortbotaniker Joseph Banks, die
"Banks Island". Auch als ich das Land mit Panoramablick auf einem der
dortigen Hügel examinierte, konnte ich mir nur schwerlich vorstellen,
dass ich auf den Überresten eines mehrere tausend Meter hohen Vulkans
stehe. Bei genauerem hinsehen kann man jedoch erkennen, das diese
zerklüfteten Hügel, die eine Halbinsel aus tentakelartigen Landzungen
bilden und im Flachland von Canterbury so fehl am Platz wirken,
Vulkanischen Ursprungs sein müssen.

Des weiteren kam ich in den Genuss der Gesellschaft eines
sympathischen, französischen Game-Developers. Nachdem ich Raphael, so
ist sein Name, mächtig über die Spielentwicklung ausquetscht hatte,
war ich sehr erstaunt, wie viel wissenschaftliche Forschung hinter der
Computergrafik steckt, auch wenn ich so etwas schon geahnt hatte
(verweis auf das National Geographic Magazin in Greymouth). Dem
schlossen sich viele Diskussionen über Politik, soziales und sogar die
Kernfusion an und ich verstehe nun, warum er am Sinn seiner Arbeit als
Game Developer zweifelt und Bienen züchten will. (Welchen Dienst tut
man an der Gesellschaft, indem man den Tag vor dem Computer verbringt,
um anderen zu ermöglichen, das gleiche zu tun und die unmittelbaren
Probleme zu vergessen. Auch wenn Ich glaube, das allein die Freude,
die man sich und anderen bringt, gewissermaßen ausgleichend wirkt. Die
Dosis macht das Gift. Auch sollte man bemerken, dass die Welt auch bei
all den Problemen nicht unbedingt vor die Hunde gehen muss. Wenn man
beispielsweise Projekte wie Wikipedia betrachtet wird klar, dass
Menschen nicht für Geld sondern aus eigenem Interesse arbeiten
können. Ferner ist die Qualität dieser Arbeit meist sogar erstaunlich
hoch. So etwas wie Open Source dürfte intuitiv gesehen eigentlich gar
nicht funktionieren, in der Realität jedoch entsteht
Erstaunliches. Komplexe Systeme, wie unser Gehirn, ein Bienenstock
oder eben Kollaboration, lassen sich weder reduktionistisch durch das
Beschreiben der einzelnen Bestandteile, noch durch die holistische
Betrachtung des Ganzen verstehen. Besonders für uns Menschen, die an
bewusste Kontrolle und Planung als menschliche Errungenschaft gewöhnt
sind, ist es schwer zu akzeptieren, dass solche stabilen und
produktiven Systeme sich zwangsläufig so gefügt (adaptiert) haben,
dass sie funktionieren. Das hat doch fast etwas Poetisches, wenn man
die Logik des Anthropischen Prinzips vernachlässigt.) Über dieses und
weiteres konnte man sich Prima Austauschen. So gut sogar, dass wir
zuletzt nicht mehr zusammen arbeiten durften, weil wir nur noch
quatschten. So mussten wir uns auf Spatziergänge und Wanderungen
Verlegen :).

Viele Ausflüge wurden unternommen: Ich wanderte, ich hörte Konzerte
und ich habe sogar eine gratis Tour zu den Albatrossen auf der Otago
Peninsula gemacht (zur Webcam, für die ich programmiert habe). Ich
habe viel gelernt. Und ich hatte viel Freude. Ich bitte die so
spärliche Berichterstattung zu verzeihen, aber es ist so schwer,
Schritt zu halten.

Jetzt geht es eine Runde Reisen mit Mama, Noemi und Falko :). Auch
wenn jeder vom Wetter etwas vom Wetter und der Umstellung angereizt
ist, wird es bestimmt ein Spaß.

Was ist nur mit dem jungen Mann. Man hört ja gar nichts mehr...

Wie immer beginne ich auch diesmal mit einer Entschuldigung. Alles ist
beim alten und Valentin schiebt den Blog immer noch vor sich her.  Der
aufwändige Produktionsprozess hat es aber auch in sich! Schreiben,
durchlesen, ausbessern und schließlich der Grammatisch-Orthografische
Korrekturgang (Ohh Ja, den gibt es wirklich! Ungelogen! Ich habe ja
kein Wort über die Effektivität verloren :P.). All das verlangt
einiges an Arbeit und damit auch Überwindung.

Wie dem auch sei (another frequently used term). Nach ein paar schönen
Reisewochen mit Muddi und F4lk0 und N03m1 und ner ganzen Packung
R0b3ts0ns gab es noch zwei schöne, aber unspektakuläre Wochen in
Wellington unter dem Dach der sehr hospitablen Frau Edith. Thank You!
Ich habe mir einen recht bereichernden Vortrag über (Sonnen)Uhren bei
einem Meeting der Wellington Astronomical Society angehört, besuchte
das "Space & Science Festival" und ward erleuchtet über Titan und die
NASA Mission zum Mars.

Wenn ich unseren roten Nachbarn auch als interessant und möglichen
Kandidaten für Kolonialisierung handle, warte ich gespannt auf die
Daten einer Europa-Sonde (Jupiter Mond, nicht Kontinent). Was
passiert, wenn wir auf einen Schlag wissen, dass Leben nicht
Terra-Exklusiv ist?

Weiter im Text: Es gab da natürlich die eine Sache, die mir
Kopfzerbrechen bereitete. Nachdem ich das Auto, the Mighty Demio, auf
Trademe gestellt hatte, erwartete ich, demnächst ein
vielbeschäftigter, in Anfragen ertrinkender Mann zu sein. Nichts Da!
Kein Muchs. Also senkte ich den Preis und pumpte 50 Dollar in Trademe,
in der Hoffnung die fehlgeleiteten Menschen da draußen, die
offensichtlich keinen guten Wagen erkennen, wenn sie einen sehen, zum
Kauf zu überreden. Immer noch nichts. Was ist das, dass kann nicht
sein! Da habe ich tatsächlich, bei einer allzu trüben Insoektion der
elektronischen Post eine (die!)  Nachfrage übersehen. Die Autorin
Derselben hatte zu meiner Erleichterung auch eine Woche später
Interesse und so stand der Deal. Ich pilgerte nach Lower Hutt, ließ
das Auto durchchecken und siehe da, man nahm mir den guten, grünen
Demio ohne jegliche Testfahrt oder persönliche Inspektion ab! Edith
witterte Betrug und Matt deichselte freundlicherweise die reibungslose
Übergabe mit mir!

Noch etwas zu meiner Schande: Ich Horst habe es nicht hinbekommen,
mich mit meinen Arbeitgebern zu treffen :/.

Einige Eskapaden gab es auch mit Matt, dem ich beim Einrichten einer
weiteren Webcam geholfen habe. Alles was schiefgehen kann geht auch
schief! Aber damit gehe ich nicht weiter ins Detail...

Dank eines Mitwagen-Transfer-Deals hatte ich den Luxus, mit all meiner
Baggage gemächlich nach Auckland fahren zu können. Auf dem Weg machte
ich mal hier, mal da, ohne genauen Plan halt und besuchte alte
Freunde. Zuerst Jean Hollis, deren Garten noch schöner ist, als ich
mich zu erinnern wägte, mit der ich wieder einmal Ukulele spielte und
die mir reichlich Äpfel und Fejoas bescherte. Eine wunderbare Sache
und eine merkwürdige Perspektive, wenn man jetzt, am Ende, zurück
schaut. Jean Hollis war/ist MONATE her. Welch zeitlichen Dimensionen.

Weiter Nördlich, in Tauranga, hatte ich noch ein Bonbon. Ich habe
Tracy (wer erinnert sich), meine Kiwi-Mum, besucht und es nicht
bereut. Reichlich zu erzählen hatten wir und gut zu Essen hatten wir
auch (denn ich habe gekocht). Was wäre bloß gewesen, hätte ich den
Flieger genommen... Tracy macht gerade dies und jenes, erfreut sich
der Diversität und hat anscheinend ihr Ding gefunden. Housesitting,
lawn-mowing, Arbeit in einem Animal-Sanctuary (mit erstaunlich vielen
Tieren) zählen dabei zu ihren momentanen Tätigkeiten.

Gestern segelte ich dann, nach einem Entspannten Kaffee mit Tracy, in
einer Nervenaufreibenden und sehr spannenden Odyssey nach
Auckland. Zuerst Stau, dann Verkehr! Und schließlich stirbt mein
Telefon. Ich erfahrener Reisender verlasse mich natürlich exklusiv auf
mein Navi und denke nicht einmal an old-fashioned Karten... Zum Glück
war ich gerade in der Nähe des "Museum of Transport and Technology"
und die freundlichen Menschen dort druckten mir eine Karte, mit der
ich dann eine halbe Stunde brauchte, um das Hostel (ein Wunderbares)
zu finden. Und warm war es. Schweißgebadet und zitternd, war ich ein
paar Kollisionen nur Haarscharf entronnen, entlud ich mein Auto und
kämpfte mich zurück zum Flughafen, den ich dann Unfreiwillig auf der
Suche nach Ace Rentals erkunde. Bei der Autovermietung war natürlich
schon keine Seele mehr und in einem Augenblick der Panik übersah ich
die Schlüsselbox. Wanderung zur Bushaltestelle + Toilette Suchen +
Wanderung in Auckland + tagelang kein guter Schlaf = Guter Schlaf. Was
für ein Abenteuer. Aber mir gefällt Auckland und dabei hört man soviel
schlechtes. Wenn man an den richtigen Orten verweilt, ist es
prima. Ich lebe gerade in Ponsonby, auf dem Hügel.


Heute habe ich mir ein Paar Teslas angeschaut. Schöne Autos, auch wenn
die Weiße Farbe der Sitze wohl etwas unglücklich gewählt ist. Ich bin
gespannt, wann Tesla ein erschwingliches Modell produzieren wird... Es
war schon interessant das Auto zu sehen, nachdem man die Biografie
(eine Ode auf Musk..., es wird fast schon langweilig) gelesen hat.
Danach, es regnete, ging es ins bereits erwähnte "Museum of Transport
and Technology", indem ich den Rest des Tages verbrachte. Selbst
nachdem man das Berliner Technikmuseum gesehen hat, wird es nicht
langweilig. Viel gab es zu erkunden und besonders das
Multiplikationslineal hat mich fasziniert. Auch gab es eine
Ausstellung mit Neuseeländischen Startups, unter denen sogar ein
Raumfahrtunternehmen zu finden war. Ich habe natürlich jedes Täfelchen
gelesen und musste durch einen Anruf auf die Öffnungszeiten aufmerksam
gemacht werden. Morgen gehe ich wieder hin :).

PS: Interessante Dampfmaschinen gab es auch: Sogar einen, in einer
Butterfabrik benutzten, ehemaligen Schiffsmotor!

Und jetzt gehts schlafen.  Bis nächste Woche in Deutschland.

***  Converting a Kawai KSP-30 to pure MIDI

:END:

My Kawai KSP-30 digital piano has been on its last leg for some time
now. To get it to work at all, I had to unplug the amplification
circuit whose interface on the main PCB was burnt out. Of course is
wasn't of much use by itself after that bit of crude surgery but
worked fine as a midi keyboard.

#+CAPTION: The main PCB.
[[file:static/images/Converting_a_Kawai_KSP-30_to_pure_MIDI/2021-08-27_18-05-08_screenshot.png]]

There must have been some creeping currents because the piano got more
and more unreliable requiring hectic powercycling to boot and finally
not booting at all. Looking for spare parts on eBay didn't bring up
anything so I decided to scan the keyboard directly with a
micro-controller and do away with the rest of the innerts of my trusty
Kawai entirely.

First I had to find out how the keyboard matrix was scanned. Luckily I
had a logic analyzer lying around to test the ports on the keyboard
connector [fn::Before I remembered having a logic analyzer however, I
fried my Raspberry Pi with the 5V logic :P.]

[[file:static/images/Converting_a_Kawai_KSP-30_to_pure_MIDI/2021-08-27_18-15-55_screenshot.png]]

Furthermore, I found the service manual for the KSP on =archive.org=
and with a little trial and error was able to puzzle it together.

#+CAPTION: The keyboard connector.
[[file:static/images/Converting_a_Kawai_KSP-30_to_pure_MIDI/2021-08-27_18-26-41_screenshot.png]]

The keyboard matrix has eight columns that can be read through =KD0=
through =KD7= [fn::Annoyingly the KDX numbers are shifted by one at
other places in the manual]. To scan all 88 keys three multiplexers
are employed that can be enabled individually by the =SA4= and =SA6=
ports (see figure above). The other three =SAX= connectors select one
of eight rows through the currently enabled multiplexer. Because the
piano is velocity sensitive, each key actually has two sensors with
one triggered shortly before the other. The time difference between
these signals can be measured to obtain the key velocity. Therefore
the =KDX= ports are split into two groups =S1= and =S2= that
correspond to the two triggers.

[[file:static/images/Converting_a_Kawai_KSP-30_to_pure_MIDI/2021-08-27_18-35-47_screenshot.png]]

Putting all this together one arrives at the following matrix.

[[file:static/images/Converting_a_Kawai_KSP-30_to_pure_MIDI/2021-08-27_18-37-23_screenshot.png]]

In practice one just cycles through the multiplexers while running a
counter to obtain the correct note because they are consecutive.

Having ascertained all this knowledge I began the realization of the
actual project by sawing out the port for the keyboard connector from
the PCB because the connector is not compatible with the usual jumper
spacings.

[[file:static/images/Converting_a_Kawai_KSP-30_to_pure_MIDI/2021-08-27_18-42-55_screenshot.png]]

Then I soldered jumper cables to one side of the connector (a real
hack job :P) and done was my not-too-fragile interface which I
promptly connected to an Arduino Nano clone I had to spare.

#+DOWNLOADED: screenshot @ 2021-08-27 18:47:12
[[file:static/images/Converting_a_Kawai_KSP-30_to_pure_MIDI/2021-08-27_18-47-12_screenshot.png]]

And finally the nasty hardware part was done and I could begin to
prototype the software on the Nano while waiting for a Pro Micro with
native USB capabilities to arrive. It suffices to say that it worked
:) with key velocity and all. After the Pro Micro arrived I even got
the sustain pedal to work :).

[[file:static/images/Converting_a_Kawai_KSP-30_to_pure_MIDI/2021-08-27_18-51-45_screenshot.png]]

With the Pro Micro set up I went on to calibrate the key sensitivity
which was less of a hassle than I thought and the project was
finished. Happily I went back to making music ever after.

The end.

Of course there remains some cleanup to be done (datatypes in the
source code). Most urgently I want to implement release velocity.
You can find the code and my personal documentation for the
project[fn::In the file named =project.org=]

Maybe this was of interest you. If not, then thanks for reading this
far anyways :P.
*** Removing legacy boot from a Linux live stick

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: removing-legacy-boot-from-a-linux-live-stick-dot
:END:
I got my ThinkPad used for a bargain price but with locked
bios/uefi-setup. Annoyingly, it defaults to legacy boot and there is no
way to change that.

My previous workaround was rather involved and is documented in the
[[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Lenovo_ThinkPad_T470#UEFI_boot][Arch wiki]]. Today however, I bricked my system at work and had to
restore it in a hurry.

It turns out that you can nuke the =MBR= of the live stick to remove
the legacy boot.

**Make sure you know what the device path of the USB stick is. You
  don't want to nuke some innocent hard drive :)!**

Over at [[https://askubuntu.com/questions/1100086/removing-extra-option-from-boot-manager-in-legacy-mode-after-deleting-ubuntu][stack exchange]] someone had a similar problem and one proposed
solution was to overwrite the first ~446~ Byte of the =MBR= with
zeros.  Find the device path of the live stick with ~lsblk~ and then
~dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx bs=446 count=1~ as root and you're set.

TL;DR Die Neuseeland-Blogposts sind nun [[/categories/neuseeland][wieder da]] und korrekt datiert.

Zwar lagen mir die Neuseeland-Blog posts als ~markdown~ quelle vor,
jedoch hatte ich den Erstellungszeitpunk unvorteilhafter Weise aus den
Dateisystem-Metadaten[fn:5] ausgelesen. Nach der Neuinstallation meines
servers vor ein paar Jahren waren diese Metadaten vollends verloren.

Meine erste Idee war zu versuchen die Zeitpunkte anhand der Email
Newsletter zu rekonstruieren. Auf diesem Wege versprach ich mir jedoch
keinen baldigen Erfolg da mein eigenes Email Archiv nicht soweit
zurueckreicht.

Zu meiner grossen Freude war letztendlich gar keine aufwaendige
Archeologie notwendig, da ich damals ausversehen einmal meinen Blog
Index in ~git~ eingecheckt hatte.

#+begin_src shell
  $ git show b1cf78b7182f0364343d2a87a1b361e7dc833688^1:data/indexes/post.json
#+end_src

Und schon hattte ich die ganze Suppe (sogar vollstaendig) in einem
maschinenlesbaren Format.

Ein wenig python verwandelte das Ganze in das neue Blog format.
#+begin_src python
  import sys
  import json
  import datetime

  with open(sys.argv[1], "r") as f:
      data = json.load(f)

      for post in data:
          export_name = (post["content"]).split("/")[-1][:-5]
          with open(post["content"][1:], "r") as cont:
              content = cont.read()
          date = datetime.datetime.strptime(post["created"], "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ")
          print(
              f"""
  ,*** {post["title"]}
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: {export_name}
  :EXPORT_DATE: [{date}]
  :END:
  {content}""")
#+end_src

Und damit koennt ihr nun unter [[/categories/neuseeland][Neuseeland]] die alten posts lesen.
